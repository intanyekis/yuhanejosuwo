Shortly after moving in, Prince painted the exterior of the house with purple stripes, installed a purple monogrammed carpet in the master bedroom, and replaced a large chandelier with a purple one. Carlos was surprised by the changes, but ultimately decided to let Prince do as he pleased since he was paying such a high rent.</p><p>However, Carlos soon received a call from Prince’s assistant requesting that all the furniture in the house be removed and replaced with his own. Carlos was hesitant, but eventually agreed to have his furniture removed and stored in the garage. When Prince moved out after three years, Carlos found that the purple carpet had ruined the hardwood floors and the walls were covered in holes from the installation of speakers. It cost Carlos over $100,000 to repair the damages.</p><p>Despite the costly experience, Carlos still speaks fondly of Prince and considers him a great artist and person.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCvwKujqKtdl7ywxsSrZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcarlos-boozer-net-worth.html&text=Carlos%20Boozer%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcarlos-boozer-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcarlos-boozer-net-worth.html&title=Carlos%20Boozer%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcarlos-boozer-net-worth.html&title=Carlos%20Boozer%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcarlos-boozer-net-worth.html&title=Carlos%20Boozer%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcarlos-boozer-net-worth.html&description=Carlos%20Boozer%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./drake-gives-fan-50000-miami-concert-after-break-up.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Drake Gifts Heartbroken Fan $50,000 At Miami Concert After Break-Up">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./burned-banksy-original-nft.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Burned Banksy Original Turned NFT, Explained">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

While the group went on an extended hiatus in 2003, the then-couple featured their romance on the MTV reality show (and pop culture juggernaut) Newlyweds, but their marriage soon started to crumble. Things came to a head when the “Sweetest Sin” singer <a href=#>filed for divorce from Lachey</a> in 2005.</p><p>“I’ll tell you how I knew my marriage was over. I was told,” the “My Everything” singer told Rolling Stone one year later, claiming that <a href=#>Simpson announced she wanted a divorce</a> while the two were in a limo after the American Music Awards. “She said something about how we hadn’t really been getting along and then said, ‘I think I want a divorce.’ That blindsided me. I basically said, ‘Please, let’s sleep on it.’ But when we woke up the next day, Wednesday morning, she was still sure.” (Simpson, for her part, detailed <a href=#>her side of the story</a> in her 2020 memoir, Open Book.)</p><p>Lachey channeled his emotions into his music, releasing the hit single, “What’s Left of Me,” in February 2006. He followed up the emotional track — which he penned in the wake of his split from Simpson — later that year with his sophomore album titled after the song.</p><p>The “Because of You” artist began dating his now-wife, <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Lachey</strong></a> (née Minnillo), after meeting on the set of the “What’s Left of Me” video. The couple tied the knot in 2011 and went on to welcome <a href=#>three children</a> together: Camden, Brooklyn and Phoenix.</p><p>As the Lacheys <a href=#>built their life together</a> and parented three kids, they also continued to achieve success in their separate — and joint — reality TV ventures. The pair have cohosted Netflix’s fan favorite dating competition series <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a>&nbsp;since 2020, and Nick won season 5 of The Masked Singer in 2021.</p><p>Despite all the positives in both his professional and personal lives, Nick found himself in <a href=#>legal trouble</a> during an incident with a celebrity photographer in March 2022.</p><p>“Last night, after enjoying a great dinner with my wife and our dear friend, the paparazzi harassed us as we walked back to our hotel,” Nick tweeted about the altercation one day later. “I clearly overreacted. I’ve been in this game long enough to know that their antics are sadly part of the deal. Stupid of me. Done.”</p><p>According to the photographer, <strong>Jody Santos</strong>, she was snapping pictures of Nick and Vanessa outside of a restaurant in Beverly Hills when the “Hardest Thing” artist became “aggressive,” she told the Daily Mail one year later. He allegedly attempted to grab her phone from her car window, which she rolled up. The cameraperson alleged that Nick punched the glass so hard “I thought he was going to break his hand.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A representative for the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office clarified to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that as a result of the incident, Nick is “participating in LADA’s Prefiling Diversion program,” which requires that “he must participate in anger management classes and attend Alcoholic Anonymous meetings.” The spokesperson added: “Successful completion of the Prefiling Diversion Program will result in no criminal charges being filed.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a timeline of Nick’s ups and downs through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNku6qvymajmpuYmsa0edSpqmaZnpl6pbvWp6pmrJinvLazx2aroZ1drrKivtJo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnick-lacheys-ups-and-downs-through-the-years.html&text=Nick%20Lachey%27s%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20Through%20the%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnick-lacheys-ups-and-downs-through-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnick-lacheys-ups-and-downs-through-the-years.html&title=Nick%20Lachey%27s%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20Through%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnick-lacheys-ups-and-downs-through-the-years.html&title=Nick%20Lachey%27s%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20Through%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnick-lacheys-ups-and-downs-through-the-years.html&title=Nick%20Lachey%27s%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20Through%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnick-lacheys-ups-and-downs-through-the-years.html&description=Nick%20Lachey%27s%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20Through%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-the-cast-of-the-100-ricky-whittle-jason-rothenberg.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This '100' Star Hated Working On The Show Due To His Boss Disgusting Conduct">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ck-chin-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-116653-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CK Chin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

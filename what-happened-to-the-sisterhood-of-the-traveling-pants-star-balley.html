A sequel was released about three years later, and plans set in motion for yet another follow-up movie.</p><p>In 2018, it was announced that the story would also be brought to Broadway, with Scott Delman of Blue Spruce Productions behind the initiative. There hasn’t been a significant update on any progress regarding those plans since then.</p><p>Blake Lively is one of the actors who featured in the original film, in what was the first major role of her acting career. She has since gone on to <a href=#>become one of the biggest movie and television stars</a> in the world.</p><p>Amber Tamblyn played the leading Tabitha "Tibby" Tomko-Rollins. Although she has also continued acting, the 39-year-old now focuses more on her writing work and activism.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Fans React To Amber Tamblyn's Essay About Britney Spears In The New York Times</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another actress who rose to prominence in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was Jenna Boyd, who famously portrayed the character Bailey Graffman.</p><h2 id=who-is-bailey-in-lsquo-the-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-rsquo>Who Is Bailey In ‘The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants’?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On Rotten Tomatoes</a>, a plot summary of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants reads: ‘Bridget, Carmen, Lena and Tibby are best friends living in Maryland. After many summers together, the four are finally going their separate ways for a few months.’</p><p>‘While Bridget heads to Mexico, and Lena visits family in Greece, Carmen and Tibby stay closer to home,’ the synopsis continues. ‘No matter where they are, they are connected by a pair of jeans that they take turns sharing… pants that fit all four girls and exemplify their tight bond.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Amber Tamblyn leading the cast as Tibby, Blake Lively, America Ferrera and Alexis Bledel completed the character line-up of the four friends, as Bridget, Carmen and Lena respectively.</p><p>Jenna Boyd was cast as Bailey Graffman, a young girl who comes to work as Tibby’s assistant, and also develops a close friendship with Tamblyn’s character.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>America Ferrera On The Bachelorette Party 'Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants'</a></span></p><p>When the film premiered in the US in June 2005, Boyd was only 12 years old.

In reality, the young actress had already built up a longer portfolio than some of her older colleagues.</p><p>Before her cameo in the 2005 smash hit, Boyd had featured in movies such as The Hunted, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, and The Missing. In that latter role,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she won a Young Artist Award</a> for ‘Best Performance in a Feature Film - Leading Young Actress.’</p><p>Boyd also preceded her appearance in the Ken Kwapis film with a number of cameos in almost ten episodes of various shows, including Six Feet Under and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What The Cast Of 'The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants' Is Up To Now</a></span></p><p>In 2002, Boyd played a main role in the Christmas movie Mary Christmas for PAX TV. The movie starred John Schneider (Smallville, The Dukes of Hazzard), who also doubled up as director.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Boyd’s character was Felice Wallace, the daughter of widower Joel Wallace, the part played by Schneider.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-jenna-boyd-after-lsquo-the-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-rsquo>What Happened To Jenna Boyd After ‘The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants’?</h2><p>While the rest of the cast of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants went on to have quite impressive careers, Jenna Boyd’s did not quite take off in the same way.</p><p>That is not exactly to say that she has had a poor run in the years since. She did spend a few years without returning to the big screen after the 2005 comedy drama, but she returned in 2012 as Maddie Rogers in a Christian, Christmas film titled Last Ounce of Courage.</p><p>In the meantime, she had featured in singular episodes of Ghost Whisperer and Criminal Minds. She also played Elizabeth Foster in the Lifetime miniseries The Gathering of 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Boyd’s biggest role of her career since The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants arguably arrived in 2017, when she started portraying Paige Hardaway in the comedy-drama series Atypical on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a>.</p><p>Paige is depicted as the very successful love interest of main character Sam, who <a href=#>lives with Asperger’s syndrome</a>. Boyd was also back in the movies this year, as Sabrina the Stalker in a romantic stoner comedy film titled Good Mourning.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Are The 'Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants' Actresses Still Friends?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsDHnmSsoaOpsrO0zqibZqeWYsGpsYytqZqulaG2r7OMqZinrKNiwLWt0WaZmqScmsZw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-star-balley.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Sisterhood%20Of%20The%20Traveling%20Pants%20Star%20Bailey%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-star-balley.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-star-balley.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Sisterhood%20Of%20The%20Traveling%20Pants%20Star%20Bailey%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-star-balley.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Sisterhood%20Of%20The%20Traveling%20Pants%20Star%20Bailey%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-star-balley.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Sisterhood%20Of%20The%20Traveling%20Pants%20Star%20Bailey%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-star-balley.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Sisterhood%20Of%20The%20Traveling%20Pants%20Star%20Bailey%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./are-lionel-scaloni-and-lionel-messi-related.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Lionel Scaloni And Lionel Messi related">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jack-draper-parents-mother-dad-who-is-jack-draper-dating-girlfriend-in-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jack Draper Parents Mother Dad: Who Is Jack Draper Dating Girlfriend?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

The duo, who have been together for over a decade, have gone through many ups and downs in their relationship.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Here’s a look at five major points in their relationship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>1. Dated Off-And-On For Several Years</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Hunt first met his wife Hannah Lee Fowler around 2008. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reportedly</a>, the singer was a quarterback at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, when the two started dating. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hunt and Fowler dated off-and-on for several years before parting ways. However, they got back together in 2016.</p><p>Though he has kept his personal life mostly away from the spotlight, he previously talked about how Fowler had acted as his muse. His 2014 debut album Montevallo was named after her hometown in Alabama.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>“I didn’t actually live in that town. I had never visited Montevallo, but right before I left to go to Nashville I met a girl from there,” he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told E! News</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“A lot of the experiences I had with her and the relationship I had with her, that inspired a lot of the songwriting on the album.”</p><h2>2. Sam Hunt and&nbsp;Hannah Lee Fowler Got Engaged in 2017</h2><p>A representative for Hunt confirmed in January 2017 that the ‘Drinkin Too Much’ hitmaker got engaged to Fowler during a trip to Israel.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Hunt <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> he popped the question by the sea of Galilee. He also shared he had big plans for the moment, but they almost didn’t work out as he and Fowler had broken into a small fight beforehand. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Sam Hunt with wife Hannah Lee Fowler.</strong> (Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Fortunately, things worked out, and the singer noted it was their brief fight that led to the perfect opportunity for his proposal. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>3. Married in His Hometown</h2><p>Months after announcing their engagement, Hunt and Fowler tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in his hometown of Cedartown, Georgia, on April 15, 2017.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wedding</a> was a small one, with only close friends and family members attending their big day.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>4. Hannah Lee Fowler Filed for Divorce</h2><p>Almost five years into their wedding, Fowler <a href=# rel="follow noopener">filed for divorce</a> from Hunt in February 2022. She quickly withdrew her petition, only to refile the case in a nearby county in the Nashville area just hours later. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fowler cited infidelity as the reason for their split, with court documents alleging Hunt was “guilty of inappropriate marital conduct” and “adultery.” The papers also revealed Fowler was pregnant and due in May 2022.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Reportedly, she was asking for alimony, child support, and primary custody of the child. She also requested for each party to be “awarded their respective separate property.”</p><h2>5. Sam Hunt and Wife Reconciled</h2><p>On May 8, 2022, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a> reported the singer and his wife had called off their divorce a month earlier. The outlet also pointed out the pair had reconciled as he was spotted wearing his wedding ring once again. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Hunt hadn’t been wearing the ring back in March when the divorce proceedings were still ongoing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It’s believed the duo decided to give their marriage another try as the date of them welcoming their first child was quickly approaching.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKCRo7uitIylnJ5llqTErbHRZqqapV2dwq%2FAjKucpZmknryvv8eip2egpKK5</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhannah-lee-fowler-sam-hunt-relationship-html.html&text=5%20Things%20to%20Know%20about%20Hannah%20Lee%20Fowler%20and%20Sam%20Hunts%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhannah-lee-fowler-sam-hunt-relationship-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhannah-lee-fowler-sam-hunt-relationship-html.html&title=5%20Things%20to%20Know%20about%20Hannah%20Lee%20Fowler%20and%20Sam%20Hunts%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhannah-lee-fowler-sam-hunt-relationship-html.html&title=5%20Things%20to%20Know%20about%20Hannah%20Lee%20Fowler%20and%20Sam%20Hunts%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhannah-lee-fowler-sam-hunt-relationship-html.html&title=5%20Things%20to%20Know%20about%20Hannah%20Lee%20Fowler%20and%20Sam%20Hunts%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhannah-lee-fowler-sam-hunt-relationship-html.html&description=5%20Things%20to%20Know%20about%20Hannah%20Lee%20Fowler%20and%20Sam%20Hunts%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./aaron-woods.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aaron Woods">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./paulo-cesar-fonseca-nunes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paulo Cesar Fonseca Nunes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

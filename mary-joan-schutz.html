Her former husband, Gene, is considered one of the greatest actors of all time, with over thirty-seven acting credits to his name. Despite his professional success, Gene's love life was less fortunate as he had three failed marriages. Among these, his marriage life with Schutz is also one.</p><p>Born on January 12, 1930, Mary is in her early 90s. She is originally from Illinois, the United States of America. Now, let's dive into Mary's bio and more!</p><h2>Mary Joan Schutz Had Two Unsuccessful Marriage</h2><p>Mary Joan Schutz not only had one but two failed marriages. Before meeting Gene, she was married to her former husband, whose identity is a mystery. With him, Gene welcomed a beautiful daughter&nbsp;<strong>Katharine Wilder</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/31/gene-and-%20(1)-1675159321273.jpeg><p>After staying in a married relationship for a couple of years, Schutz and her first husband decided to divorce. However, they have not revealed the exact reason behind their divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>After the divorce, Mary met Gene in 1967, and they both began dating each other. After dating each other for some time, they tied the knot on&nbsp;<strong>October 27, 1967</strong>, in a private wedding ceremony. Their family members, friends, and relatives attended the couple's wedding.</p><p>Gene also legally adopted Katharine as his daughter. In the initial stage, their relationship was going well off. However, soon things started to get bitter. They sadly ended their marital bond in&nbsp;<strong>1974&nbsp;</strong>and walked their separate ways.</p><h2>Life Of Mary Joan Schutz After The Divorce With Gene</h2><p>After being separated from Gene, Schutz started living a secretive life away from the media attention. So it is still a mystery whether she dated or married anyone after parting with her former spouse.&nbsp;</p><p>If Schutz did not marry afterward, considering her age, she might be leading a single and blissful life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mary Joan Schutz's Only Daughter</h2><p>Mary Joan Schutz is blessed with a gorgeous daughter, Katharine Wilder, from her first marriage. However, detail regarding her biological father is still behind the curtains.&nbsp;</p><p>After Gene adopted Katharine in 1997, she started calling him father. Despite being the daughter of the legendary actor, Katharine has lived a life away from the media presence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/31/Katharine-Wilder%20(1)-1675159456149.jpeg><p>Per the reports, Katharine shattered her bond with Gene at twenty-two for some reason. In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>Larry King Live in 2002</a>, Gene stated that he had lost his daughter a while ago.</p><h2>How Rich Is Mary Joan Schutz?</h2><p>Mary Joan Schutz has an estimated net worth of&nbsp;<strong>$200 thousand</strong>. However, she has not shared any clues regarding her profession in the media.</p><p>Mary's late ex-husband, Gene Wilder, had a net worth of&nbsp;<strong>$20 million&nbsp;</strong>at the time of his demise. He had earned this huge sum through his successful career as an actor and director. Throughout his career, he had thirty-seven acting credits and ten writing credits.</p><h2>About Mary's Late Husband's Three Failed Marriage&nbsp;</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Gene Wilder had three unsuccessful marriage bonds like&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Bern Nadette Stanis</strong></a>. Besides Mary, Gene was married to Mary Mercier and Gilda Radner.</p><p>Gene's first wife was&nbsp;<strong>Mary Mercier</strong>, who was an actress. She has eight acting credits in her IMDb profile. They tied the knot in a private wedding ceremony on July 22, 1960. However, their marriage lasted only five years as they parted ways in&nbsp;<strong>1965</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/31/Gene%20Wilder%20%20(1)-1675159739123.jpeg><p>In Saint-Tropez, Gene tied the knot with&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Gilda Radner</strong></a>&nbsp;on September 18, 1984. She was also an actress. The ex-pair first met each other on a movie set. Gilda describes their first meeting as "<i>love at first sight.</i>"</p><p>Unfortunately, the former duo Gene and Glida only stayed together for five years. Their marital bond ended after the demise of Gilda in 1989.</p><h2>Mary Joan Schutz's Ex-Husband Gene Married Karen Boyer, Which Lasted Till His Demise</h2><p>Although three unsuccessful marriages, Gene finally found the love of his life,&nbsp;<strong>Karen Boyer</strong>. His wife is an American Costume designer by profession. He spent the rest of his life without rumors or controversy with Karen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/31/Gene%20and%20Karen%20(1)-1675159891785.jpeg><p>Gene and Karen initially met each other in&nbsp;<strong>1989</strong>. At that time, Gene was preparing for a film shoot. After dating each other for over two years, they exchanged their wedding vows on September 8, 1991.</p><p>Gene and Karen had strong bonds with each other and supported each other in the hard times. They only got separated from each other after the demise of Gene in&nbsp;<strong>2016</strong>.</p><h2>How Did Mary Joan Schutz's Ex-Husband Pass Away?</h2><p>Gene Wilder died at eighty-three on August 29, 2016, at home in Stamford, Connecticut. He dies because of Alzheimer's disease. He had been suffering from the disease for three years before his demise.</p><p>If you wonder what Alzheimer's is, it is a type of disease that directly affects memory, thinking, and behavior. However, Will & Grace actor Gene kept this information away from the eye of his fans and followers. Sadly, he passed away in 2016 due to complications in his disease.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is Mary Joan Schutz Doing Today?</h3><p>After her divorce from Gene Wilder, Mary Joan Schutz mostly stayed away from the limelight. Likewise, today, Mary leads her life behind the curtains. As such, the celebrity ex-wife in her early 90s leads her life peacefully.</p><p>Much like Mary, his adopted daughter, Katharine Wilder, likes to keep her life away from the spotlight. While Katharine is active in her career as an actress, her mother Schutz is away from anything that pushes her into the spotlight.</p><p><i>For More Exciting News and Talk About Other Celebrities, Please Visit</i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i>.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqaYq7Fdn7yiuoysmqGtpK8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmary-joan-schutz.html&text=Life%20Update%21%20Where%20Is%20Mary%20Joan%20Schutz%2c%20Ex-wife%20Of%20Gene%20Wilder%20Now%3f%20Marriage%2c%20Bio%20and%20More%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmary-joan-schutz.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmary-joan-schutz.html&title=Life%20Update%21%20Where%20Is%20Mary%20Joan%20Schutz%2c%20Ex-wife%20Of%20Gene%20Wilder%20Now%3f%20Marriage%2c%20Bio%20and%20More%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmary-joan-schutz.html&title=Life%20Update%21%20Where%20Is%20Mary%20Joan%20Schutz%2c%20Ex-wife%20Of%20Gene%20Wilder%20Now%3f%20Marriage%2c%20Bio%20and%20More%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmary-joan-schutz.html&title=Life%20Update%21%20Where%20Is%20Mary%20Joan%20Schutz%2c%20Ex-wife%20Of%20Gene%20Wilder%20Now%3f%20Marriage%2c%20Bio%20and%20More%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmary-joan-schutz.html&description=Life%20Update%21%20Where%20Is%20Mary%20Joan%20Schutz%2c%20Ex-wife%20Of%20Gene%20Wilder%20Now%3f%20Marriage%2c%20Bio%20and%20More%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./professional-indoor-lacrosse-league-coming-queen-city-2023-with-charlotte-bootleggers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Professional indoor lacrosse league coming to Queen City in 2023 with the Charlotte Bootleggers  ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-bill-hemmer-gay-everything-on-the-journalists-sexuality-and-love-life-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Bill Hemmer Gay?

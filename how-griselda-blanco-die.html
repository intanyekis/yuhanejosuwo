If you’re wonderin<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1689480/gypsy-rose-husband/>g how Griselda Blanco really died</a> after she was caught for her involvement in the Miami Drug War, here’s everything to know.</p><p>Sofia Vergara stars and is the executive producer of <a href=# id=auto-tag_griselda data-tag=griselda>Griselda</a> which follows Blanco’s move to the United States from Colombia as she created one of the most powerful cartels in history and her great involvement in the Miami Drug War&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Cocaine Cowboy Wars. The show also stars Alberto Guerra, Christian Tappan, Martín Rodríguez, Juliana Aidén Martinez, Vanessa Ferlito, and Karol G making her on-screen debut.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jimmy-chelsea-back-together-love-is-blind.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-is-blind-gold-cups.png><p>In her portrayal of the “Godmother of Cocaine,” Vergara made sure to tell the story with care. “These sort of real-life characters always have to be larger than life and enigmatic, in a way,” she said in a press statement. “If you’re familiar with any other narcos stories, you know that these people would always come up under the guise of helping to build up their communities, and employing a lot of people in need. During Griselda’s time, the idea of a woman being at the head of a cartel — simply due to how ruthless and violent a person that would have to be — was just crazy. No one could believe that she was capable of doing the horrible things that she was doing. Her mixture of femininity and the worst parts of masculinity are compelling to anyone. It’s like a horrible crash on a freeway; we all turn to look.”</p><p>Creator and executive producer Eric Newman explained why this portrayal of Blanco is a necessary deviation from others. “We realized that all the stories we had heard about Griselda were written or told by men in the same business as Griselda, or who were <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1701867/denise-huskins-now/>trying to catch her,</a>” he said. “We started to recognize a pattern in all the stories about this demon that she had been made out to be. I’d spent a lot of time telling the story of complicated narcotics traffickers who killed people and blew up airplanes, murdered their rivals and allies alike, and there wasn’t the same level of vitriol toward them. There wasn’t the same level of “Oh, that’s a bad woman.” It became an entry point to the story: here’s a woman who actually was beloved by people who worked for her, who inspired a tremendous amount of loyalty.”</p><p>So how did Griselda Blanco die read more to find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-did-griselda-blanco-die>How did Griselda Blanco die?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/griselda-blanco-.jpg><p>After her prison release, Blanco was deported back to Medellín, Colombia where she reportedly<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1689480/gypsy-rose-husband/> lived a quiet life</a>. She was killed on September 3, 2012, in the same assassination style that she was often credited with—shot down by two assassins on a motorcycle. “She wasn’t hiding. Not at all,” former Agent Bob Palombo told <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/griselda-blanco-sofia-vergara-netflix-b2051670.html>The Independent.</a> “She was killed at the marketplace, the butcher shop, and according to my sources, she lived a well-respected life in the community. She was supposedly very benevolent to the downtrodden and that may have been a reason that a lot of people didn’t bother with her.”</p><p>Griselda Blanco was caught in Irvine, California on February 17, 1985, after she was tracked by DEA agents for about ten years. According to The United States v. Blanco, Blanco gave a false name to the DEA agents who arrested her, and she was found to be carrying false identification papers.</p><p>“She was pretty tough and standoffish, a typical Colombian move I would say, nonchalant, not really showing any real emotion, but when we put her in the car, I was in the backseat with her, and the other agent was driving. We drove up to Los Angeles, and when we got close to the courthouse is when she became visibly shaken,” retired Agent Bob Palombo told <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/griselda-blanco-sofia-vergara-netflix-b2051670.html>The Independent.</a> “I mean, visibly shaken, she was shaking, and she grabbed my arm and you could feel her shaking and she turned and she threw up on my shoulder. Not a lot, it was mostly just bile, but she knew the proverbial s*** had hit the fan. And it was time for her to meet her accusers.”</p><p>She was released in 2004 due to her health issues, and suffered a heart attack in prison in 2002. She was believed to be responsible for at least 40 killings and up to 200 in total. Griselda is survived by her son, Michael. Her three sons with&nbsp;her first husband,&nbsp;Uber, Osvaldo and Dixon Trujillo, were all killed after getting into the drug trade.</p><p>Days before the premiere of the <a href=# id=auto-tag_netflix data-tag=netflix>Netflix</a> show, Michael Corleone, identified as Michael Sepulvedablanco in the lawsuit documents, and his wife, Marie, are seeking damages “in excess of $50,000,” as well as an emergency temporary injunction to block the January 25 release of&nbsp;Griselda.</p><p>Michael accuses the show’s creators of using his unreleased “artistic literary work” and his likeness “to depict the life story of himself and his mother, Griselda Blanco De Trujillo” without permission or credit, according to the lawsuit obtained by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight.</a></p><p>The family made a statement to the site: “It is beyond dispute that Griselda Blanco made the ultimate decision for Michael Blanco, her son, to carry out and benefit from her life as it relates to artistic and literary productions based on her story. Although Michael Blanco is a public figure himself with his own rights to publicity, Mr. Blanco continues to honor his mother’s executed intent. Since 2008, Michael Blanco has worked extremely hard in the entertainment industry where he conducted numerous interviews and tv shows to tell his story. He is also the outstanding author of the book entitled, “My Mother, the Godmother and the True Story of Michael Corleone Blanco the Son of Griselda Blanco.” He published this book in an attempt to fulfill his mother’s wishes and tell the world the intimate details about his life and that of his mother, Griselda Blanco. It is a compelling story.</p><p>Michael Blanco was more than willing to share his hard work and the nonpublic details of his mother’s life with Latin World Entertainment/Netflix if he was to be fairly compensated. Make no mistake, Michael Blanco is humble and thrilled each and every time someone reaches out to shine light on his mother and the Blanco family. However, in the case of Netflix/Latin World Entertainment, the Defendants approached Michael Blanco to gain his work, perspective, and insight to only turn around and act like he does not exist, in an apparent attempt to reap their own profits. It is disappointing that Latin World Entertainment/Netflix would pretend that it is acceptable to use Michael Blanco’s commercial work without his permission.”</p><p>In a statement to DailyMail, he explained his&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>reasoning for legal action</a>, “I feel that it’s my duty to do it. And if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be keeping my word to my OG, to my mother. I’m just holding it down for the family – and I’m doing it legally.”</p><p>He continued, ‘I am a history buff so I believe that history should be told not only by the victors, but by the losers. You can call me what you want but I’m in both worlds. Some people will say, ‘You’re glorifying the lifestyle’. I glorify my mother but when you read my book and you’ll see my public apology to the masses, and to the victims of the 1970s and 1980s cocaine and crack wars. I’m apologetic because I myself am a victim… I buried 22 members of my family. I survived countless assassination’s attempts. Look at the way I lost my mother.”</p><p><strong>Griselda is now streaming on Netflix.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_16ad4f.png><p>A profile of bloodthirsty Colombian drug dealer Griselda Blanco, known as the “Black Widow” due to her penchant for killing off her lovers, recounts <a data-pmc-sp-product=ac48495d7ea88daa3005e7dce76204d6 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Blanco’s vicious crime spree","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"The Godmother: The True Story of the Hunt for the Most Bloodthirsty Female Criminal in Our Time","id":"0671701932","category":"True Crime"},"id":1703476,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Blanco’s vicious crime spree</a> and the ten-year struggle to bring her to justice. Court records and interviews with Drug Enforcement Administration agents, federal attorneys, Miami police and Blanco’s acquaintances flesh out a portrait of a ruthless cocaine wholesaler whose “mules” (couriers) transported drugs in women’s undergarments and shoe heels. Her propensity for violence was legendary: she bragged of murdering her husband and claimed responsibility for Miami’s “Dadeland Massacre,” a shootout in a mall parking lot that disposed of one of Blanco’s creditors.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

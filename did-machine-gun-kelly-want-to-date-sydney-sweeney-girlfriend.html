So why are 31-year-old Machine Gun Kelly and 24-year-old Sydney Sweeney being linked to each other — and what is their relationship like today?</p><h2 id=does-sydney-sweeney-know-machine-gun-kelly>Does Sydney Sweeney Know Machine Gun Kelly?</h2><p>Machine Gun Kelly and Sydney Sweeney met in 2018 on the set of the coming-of-age comedy movie Big Time Adolescence, which also stars <a href=#>the musician's close friend Pete Davidson</a>. Big Time Adolescence follows a suburban teenager and his best friend, a college dropout. In the movie Davidson and Sweeney portray love interests.

"I walk in and you [and Pete] are literally tattooing each other," she said at the time. "I'm like, 'Ok, this is the coolest set I’ve ever been on.'"</p><p>The musician and the actress also worked together on the drama movie Downfalls High which is based on the album of the same name by Machine Gun Kelly. The movie premiered on January 15, 2021, on Facebook, and it stars TikTok influencer Chase Hudson as a quiet high schooler and Sydney Sweeney as the school's popular girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Thought Sydney Sweeney Was Secretly Dating These Celebrities">Fans Thought Sydney Sweeney Was Secretly Dating These Celebritie</a></span></p><p>Downfalls High was written and directed by Machine Gun Kelly and Mod Sun, and it was filmed in four days during the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's what the musician revealed about the movie</a>:</p><p>"I love how our lead who’s whose character name is Phoenix and the, and our other lead, her whose name is Scarlet. You know, when, when he loses Scarlet, he’s faced with temptation success and, you know, he’s young, he has the opportunity to get over this person, but he never does. And in that it drives him crazy. That is, I just wanted to highlight themes that aren’t made in movies. I’m sick of seeing people like treat love like it’s trivial, right. That we can just move past it. Like, because if it’s real love, you can’t move past it and you shouldn’t move past it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-also-worked-with-megan-fox>Sydney Sweeney Also Worked With Megan Fox</h2><p>Apart from working with Machine Gun Kelly on two separate projects, Sydney Sweeney is also no stranger to the musician's finacé. In 2021, the actress worked together with Megan Fox on the vampire thriller Night Teeth. Apart from the two, the movie also stars Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Debby Ryan, and Lucy Fry — and it follows a freelance chauffeur driving two girls around Los Angeles without knowing that they are vampires.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Deeper Meaning Behind 8 Of Machine Gun Kelly's Most Popular Songs">The Deeper Meaning Behind 8 Of Machine Gun Kelly's Most Popular Songs</a></span></p><p>While the movie received mixed reviews, Sydney Sweeney and Megan Fox's performances were praised, and fans are even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hoping that the two collaborate again on a prequel to the movie</a>.

But I trust Colson more with a tattoo, and I think that he would do something that I’d want, so I’d probably do [my dog] Tank’s paw print or something.

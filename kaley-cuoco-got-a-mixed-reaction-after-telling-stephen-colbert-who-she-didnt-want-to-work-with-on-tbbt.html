Of course, the show would go on for another three seasons, wrapping up during season 12. Among the topics of conversation included the potential of Leonard and Penny having children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although they are expecting in the final season, Cuoco clearly feels indifferent at this point. Not only that, but she tells Colbert that she has no interest in working with babies either on the show, which gets a bit of mixed reaction from the audience on-hand.</p><p>She says, "I hope not, I don't like working with kids. I like kids, I don't want to work with them. Babies are really tough to work with. They're the biggest divas, people carry them in, and they only work like six minutes."</p><p>"They make any sounds they like. They talk, they cry.

We wanted to leave the audience with the idea that these friendships and the love that they have continues.”</p><p>Kaley Cuoco also understood the decision, but was open to not having children.</p><p>"I actually wished that they did not [make Penny pregnant] because I loved that message [of Penny not wanting kids] so much."

I didn’t expect it at all because they’ve been playing against it for so long.

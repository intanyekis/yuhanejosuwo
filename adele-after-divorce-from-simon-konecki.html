Sources later confirmed that the two were, indeed, divorcing after just three years of marriage. While a breakup can be hard on anybody, the Someone Like You hitmaker appears to have handled the split exceptionally well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have been stunned by Adele's dramatic weight loss over the past year; she reportedly hired Lady Gaga's personal trainer, along with a chef that was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended to her by Cameron Diaz</a>. However, her health journey isn't the only thing that she's focused her attention on,</p><p>She recently revealed that her fourth studio album would be out by September. She also enjoyed a trip to Anguilla with her pals, James Corden and Harry Styles. So, what else has she been up to since splitting from her soon-to-be ex-husband? Here's the lowdown.</p><h2 id=she-hired-a-personal-chef><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>She Hired A Personal Chef</span></h2><p>In May, it was revealed that Adele had hired personal chef, Jason Harley, to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">assist her on her weight loss journey</a>, with reports also claiming that the singer’s daily food intake doesn’t surpass 1,000 calories, which is a very low daily calorie count. Harley has previously worked with the likes of Cameron Diaz, so Adele was in good hands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-changed-her-personal-trainer><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>She Changed Her Personal Trainer</span></h2><p>When Adele decided to make California her permanent home, she hired personal trainer, Harley Pasternak, who’s famously known for training with VIPs, such as Lady Gaga and Rihanna. The 'Rolling in the Deep' singer reportedly works out five times a week. She does a program specifically designed for her needs - judging by the results, Pasternak is definitely doing his job.</p><h2 id=she-s-flaunted-her-new-figure-on-instagram><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>She’s Flaunted Her New Figure On Instagram</span></h2><p>Adele celebrated her 32nd birthday on May 5, and to mark the occasion, she posted a photo of herself on Instagram, thanking her fans for their good wishes and kind words. However, it wasn’t the message that kept people’s attention; it was her drastic weight loss, which she showed off in a small black dress.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Could You Live Across The Street From Your Ex After A Divorce? Adele Does!</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-revealed-her-next-album-s-release-date><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Revealed Her Next Album’s Release Date</span></h2><p>In February 2020, Adele attended one of her friends’ wedding parties, where she announced that her next studio album <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">would be released later this year</a>. She told guests to “expect my album in September.” An official announcement has yet to be made, but it’s more than likely that fans will get new music from Adele towards the end of this year.</p><h2 id=she-sold-her-sussex-mansion><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She Sold Her Sussex Mansion</span></h2><p>In April 2020, Adele <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold her West Sussex property</a> in the UK, which she put on the market shortly after her divorce announcement. The ’Someone Like You’ hitmaker bought the property for a reported $4.8 million in 2017, but she only made $3.6 million from the sale. She must have really wanted to get rid of that home to settle for a $1.2 million loss.</p><h2 id=she-permanently-moved-to-los-angeles><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Permanently Moved To Los Angeles</span></h2><p>While she initially planned on raising her son in the UK, Adele found herself traveling to California so often that she decided to make the move permanent. On top of that, she announced her divorce from Simon last year, so her relocation to sunny California could have been prompted by her marriage coming to an end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-asked-a-judge-to-keep-her-divorce-private><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Asked A Judge To Keep Her Divorce Private</span></h2><p>Adele didn’t sign a prenuptial agreement when she married Simon, so he stands a great chance of walking away with plenty of her money. However, we won’t ever know how much he got because a judge has ruled that the divorce proceedings will move ahead privately, according to sources. Any official who requires access to those details will have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything There Is To Know About Adele’s Trainer, Pete Geracimo</a></span></p><h2 id=she-s-been-gradually-losing-weight><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She’s Been Gradually Losing Weight</span></h2><p>Adele’s weight loss didn’t happen overnight. While she’s barely recognizable these days, the 32-year-old has been working out for years. Ever since moving to Los Angeles, she’s been extremely consistent with her diet and workouts. Even on her Instagram page, she often shares photos of herself hiking with friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-held-her-31st-birthday-bash-at-the-godfather-mansion><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Held Her 31st Birthday Bash At The Godfather Mansion</span></h2><p>When Adele celebrated her 31st birthday in May 2019, she held a massive party at the mansion where ‘The Godfather’ was filmed, in Beverly Hills. Everyone, from Jay-Z and Beyoncé to Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, attended the bash, but few photos ever surfaced. Adele likes to keep her life private.</p><h2 id=she-reportedly-dated-british-rapper-skepta><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Reportedly Dated British Rapper, Skepta</span></h2><p>At the end of 2019, it was claimed that Adele had been dating Skepta. He is a pal who is a British rapper. The two, according to reports, had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">enjoyed multiple date nights</a> together, just months after her divorce from Simon was announced. They’d been friends for years, so it seemed like a great fit when things transitioned into romance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Much Adele’s Changed Since 2006, In Photos</a></span></p><h2 id=but-their-relationship-didn-t-last-long><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>But Their Relationship Didn’t Last Long</span></h2><p>By March 2020, sources claimed that the rumored couple had called it quits. It’s not clear as to why the pair decided to go their separate ways, but Skepta had apparently hinted at dating the singer in his song ‘Mic Check.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Can you handle the fame?

For the occasion, the songstress dressed up as Captain Hook, but she altered the look to her own liking.

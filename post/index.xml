1992年に26歳の若さで亡くなってしまいましたが、彼は既婚者で子供がいました。
生前、同じく歌手の斉藤由貴さんとの不倫関係が有名でした。
女性に纏わる噂も多かったことから、過去には他にも子供がいるのではないか？という諸説が存在しました。
死後30年以上経っているのに公な子供は妻・繁美さんとの間に生まれた息子・裕哉（ひろや）さんだけです。
女性関係で色々あっただけに、もしかした明らかになっていない隠し子がいるのではないか？という疑惑があります。
また、嫁・繁美さんとの間に生まれた息子の裕哉さんの現在の歌手活動なども追ってみてみたいです。
尾崎豊の息子・裕哉（ひろや）。1989年生まれでアメリカ育ちで英語堪能
名前 尾崎 裕哉（おざき ひろや） 生年月日 1989年7月24日 出身地 東京都 血液型 O型 父親 尾崎豊 母親 尾崎繁美 学歴 慶応義塾大学
職業 シンガーソングライター 尾崎豊さんは1988年に、一般人の女性・繁美（しげみ）さんと結婚しました。
そして、結婚した1年後の1989年の７月２４日に、第一子の長男の「裕哉（ひろや）」が誕生してます。
尾崎豊さんは1992年に亡くなってしまったのですが、その間に第二子の子供が生まれることはありませんでした。
つまり、尾崎豊さんと妻・繁美さんとの間に生まれた子供は、息子の裕哉さんただ一人で間違いありません。
裕哉さんは1994年に母の繁美さんと共にアメリカに渡ります。
なぜ妻・繁美と息子・裕哉は渡米したのか？陰謀説に恐怖 なぜ、母子でアメリカに渡ったかというと、1994年に尾崎豊さんの死の真相について不可解な点があり、母の繁美さんによる陰謀ではないか？という説が出たからです。
ある記者は、尾崎豊さんの死の真実は、妻・繁美さんとの軋轢にあると憶測を立てていました。
その説を信じる熱狂的なファンが、繁美さんに対して嫌がらせを始め、それに恐怖を感じた繁美さんは裕哉さんを連れて海外に脱出したということです。
その後に、妻・繁美さんはその説を記事にした記者を裁判で訴え、見事に勝訴してます。
遺書の存在は息子・裕哉への影響を考えて長年非公開 2011年に尾崎豊さんが生前に書いたとされる遺書が公開されました。
遺書を公開したのは1994年から妻・繁美さんを直接取材し続けていたジャーナリストです。
遺書の内容には、尾崎豊さんがずっと死を意識していたことが綴られております。
当時まで3歳だった息子への影響を考え、遺書の存在を長年伝えていませんでした。
2011年に、裕哉さんが２２歳まで公開しなかったのは、ジャーナリストが妻・繁美さんとの約束を守ったということです。
息子・尾崎裕哉の現在は歌手。父・豊と顔と声が似てる？
東京に生まれた尾崎豊さんの息子・裕哉さんですが、3歳の頃に母・繁美さんと共にアメリカのボストンに渡ります。
渡米したばかりの頃は英語がろくに話せず、いじめれることもあったそうです。つまりはインターナショナルスクールではなく普通の学校に通っていたかと思われます。
その後に15歳で帰国してます。長年アメリカにいた経験から、ネイティブな英語の発音を取得しています。
尾崎裕哉は高校卒業後に「慶應義塾大学」の環境情報学部に進学しました。
卒業後は慶應義塾大学大学院に進学し、2015年に大学院の過程も修了しています。
裕哉さんは小学6年生の頃から父親・尾崎豊の楽曲を聴くようになったそうです。</description></item><item><title>10 Actors Who Have Written Episodes Of The Shows They Star In</title><link>/actors-who-have-written-episodes-of-the-shows-they-star-in.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/actors-who-have-written-episodes-of-the-shows-they-star-in.html</guid><description>Once someone has made it into Hollywood, it can be easy for them to jump around from job to job assuming they're talented.

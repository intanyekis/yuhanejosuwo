But not every role in Hollywood calls for a person that&nbsp;is aesthetically pleasing. And while the actors that get cast in these roles may be gorgeous in real life, you would never know it if you only looked at them in these roles. But thankfully, that's where we come in. As we go through 15 of the more physically repulsive characters that Hollywood has asked for a role, but also show what these actors typically look like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of these actors would spend hours every day making sure their appearance was ugly enough for the cameras. A job that becomes a lot harder when someone like Thesy Surface, who plays the repulsive Margaret McPoyle in&nbsp;It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, is stunning. Or&nbsp;Daveigh Chase who scared you senseless in&nbsp;The Ring, but her good looks may mean that the idea of asking her on a date may be an even more intimidating task to conquer.</p><p>Several actors have also shown their dedication to a role by making that transformation not only in the makeup chair&nbsp;but in the grocery store. Charlize Theron recently packed on some serious poundage for her recent role thanks to her new good friend, potato chips. Perhaps she took inspiration from actors like Jonah Hill who ballooned up for&nbsp;War Dogs. And while you may love looking at Margot Robbie, you probably wouldn't guess it's her when you see her in one of the most exciting upcoming movies&nbsp;Queen of Scots&nbsp;that also stars Saoirse Ronan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These are the 15 best examples when attractive celebrities were asked to play characters that were far from it!</p><h2 id=delphine-chan-ac---splice><strong>Delphine Chanéac - Splice</strong></h2><p>Delphine Chanéac knew that her face wasn't exactly going to get recognized after her appearance in the science-fiction film, Splice.</p><p>The film saw her play the role of Dren. The film&nbsp;also had Adrien Brody step into the lead role and it scored 74% on Rotten Tomatoes. So if you're looking for an entertaining and well-made science-fiction film, we may have found what you're watching next.</p><p>When discussing the role with Popcorn Biz, it was revealed by the director Vincenzo Natali that the original intention was to give Dren hair. But after the process proved to be too expensive, Chanéac stepped up and offered to shave off her own hair. Though there was one condition.</p><p><strong>"My only demand was that I do it myself. I went to this hairdresser on the mall in Toronto where we were shooting, grabbed the little machine and cut it across my head for fun."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a look that Chanéac also seemed to embrace in her day-to-day life away from the set,&nbsp;"They bought me a wig, but I didn't want to wear it. I was bald."&nbsp;Though you may think she looks even more beautiful with a full head of hair in the photo we've selected on the right.</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBCChicago</a>)</p><h2 id=matthew-mcconaughey---gold-196><strong>Matthew McConaughey - Gold (196)</strong></h2><p>Sadly for Matthew McConaughey, Gold was one of the more disappointing films of his career. The film failed to make back its budget, earning $11.5 million versus the $20 million budget, and also scored a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 42%.</p><p>But McConaughey can definitely say that he had a lot of fun transforming his body for the role. When McConaughey talked about how he attained the 47-pound weight gain that he amassed over 6 months he stated, he said,</p><p><strong>"No exercise, I wouldn't even take the floors to the 2nd floor, that would be too much exercise. I was eating cheeseburgers all the time..trying out all these fast-food restaurants I've only had one time...Cheeseburgers and beers would do the trick,"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also mentioned,&nbsp;"You could say yes to whatever you wanted to eat, whatever you wanted to drink. Whenever that was fun. The only thing that gets tiring was the thought of quitting"</p><p>McConaughey also said his family loved the look, saying,&nbsp;"They loved it, I was captain fun, that was my nickname around the house because I'd say yes to everything. No pizza it's not just a Friday night, it's Tuesday night into Wednesday morning."</p><p>Though we're sure it was much less fun when instead of Dad going out for Pizza, Dad was waking up and slamming back the healthier meals that he must have had in order to lose the weight.</p><p>(Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>)</p><h2 id=daveigh-chase-the-ring-163><strong>Daveigh Chase –The Ring (163)</strong></h2><p>When you watch the 2002 horror film, The Ring, you may spend a significant amount of time with your head buried in your hands. Because let's be honest, that movie has definitely earned its mark as being one of the scariest, albeit, most successful film franchises in the horror genre. The fright level gets dialed up to 10 (if not even higher!) whenever Daveigh Chase shows up on the screen, looking like she does in the photo from the movie that we have featured.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film was successful enough to spawn a franchise with the third one, Rings, coming out in 2017. While it was less successful than either of the first two, at least financially, the film does star Johnny Galecki. So if you're a fan of The Big Bang Theory, you may an extra enjoyment out of it.</p><p>Chase did make headlines in relation to her character when back in 2016 she took to Instagram in October to say,</p><p>"Should I be sl*ty Samara for Halloween? lol."</p><p>She didn't seem to go ahead with the idea, but if she ever needs to find herself back in the spotlight, that's definitely a pretty good way to do it as we're sure the tabloids news sites would love to cover it.</p><p>(Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki for Rings</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki For The Ring 2</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki For The Ring</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror</a>)</p><h2 id=james-franco-spring-breakers-198><strong>James Franco – Spring Breakers (198)</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>James Franco has several roles where he's been able to embrace his good looks to help win over the audience. But it doesn't take a very hard look at his character in Spring Breakers to realize that wasn't going to be the case with this film. Which to be fair, does have other actors such as Selena Gomez who has no problems embracing her love.</p><p>When talking about the look, Franco stated,</p><p><strong>"We wanted it to be extreme, but we have to find that balance between a little goofy, a little scary, and also kind of grounded. It's not just a clown outfit—this is somebody that likes how he looks."</strong></p><p>One of the most "memorable" parts of the look are Franco's teeth, which he also admitted was very nearly a decision that was left out of the final product</p><p>"And then we almost didn't do—I can't believe this—we almost didn't do full grillz. It was that balance of caricature and real guy, so when I first left the grillz in, I was like, 'Ohhhh'—"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was far from the most successful movie of Franco's career, but it did score a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 67% and also made over $30 million on a budget of only 5$ million, so we're sure everyone involved was happy with how the end product looked.</p><p>(Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BirthMoviesDeath</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>)</p><h2 id=naomi-grossman---american-horror-story-130><strong>Naomi Grossman - American Horror Story (130)</strong></h2><p>Naomi Grossman is definitely willing to put the time in to help transform herself from the beautiful woman, into the character of Pepper who shows up in American Horror Story: Asylum and again in American Horror Story: Freak Show.</p><p>When Grossman was asked about the time it takes to transform into Pepper, she replied,</p><p><strong>"It takes about two-and-a-half hours. It consists of a nose, brows, ears, man hands, fake teeth, and a contact lens. Of course [there is] the shaved head and they have a thing with the little pigtail that they apply, as well."</strong></p><p>Which means she probably has plenty of time to go over her lines for that day on set!</p><p>Accepting the role also meant that Grossman had to be comfortable with shaving her head. Thankfully, it was a decision that Grossman had no regrets about,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When they were sort of creating the character physically, it became apparent that a bald cap would require another couple of hours in the makeup chair, which of course I was happy to do if it meant being able to keep my hair. But at the same time, I’m an actress and this is what we do for our art [and] clearly they knew what they were doing...Honestly, I think all women should [shave]. It’s liberating."</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA-Confidential-Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>)</p><h2 id=bill-skarsg-rd-it><strong>Bill Skarsgård – It</strong></h2><p>There have been many amazing horror movies that have come out as of late. Such as Get Out, that saw Jordan Peele take home the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. But as scary as Get Out was, It is one of, if not, the scariest movies to come out in recent memory. In fact, we wouldn't be surprised if getting another look at Pennywise is enough to cause some nightmares!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though if it does, we are sincerely sorry. Bill wasn't the first actor to get a crack at the character, as Tim Curry previously played&nbsp;the clown in the miniseries. When talking about the potential influence of Curry's performance, Skarsgård stated,</p><p>"I watched the miniseries and really appreciated Tim Curry’s take on it, but now I had to do something completely different. Obviously, that’s not something you study. I wouldn’t see the point in making a film that’s similar to the one that’s already been made, so I didn’t try to think too much about that. I just worked really hard to create my own interpretation of Stephen King’s character."</p><p>Considering the movie went on to earn over $700 million at the box office, it is safe to say that people were happy with the performance he put out.</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki for It</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>)</p><h2 id=america-ferrera---ugly-betty-169><strong>America Ferrera - Ugly Betty (169)</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you consider America Ferrera was the star of Ugly Betty, she perhaps knew going into it that her best features weren't exactly going to get highlighted. And while the show found itself being canceled after 4 seasons, we're sure Ferrera is still ecstatic for the opportunity that Ugly Betty presented her. Even if it also presented the audience with some seriously awful outfits!</p><p>Ferrera was once asked to talk about her opinion on her character, Betty Suarez, leading her to reveal,&nbsp;"For me, this character is a transformative character and she's a girl who owns her skin and her body and her womanhood, her confidence and her career."</p><p>Ferrera also indicated at one point that she would have been very interested in potentially turning the television show into a movie. Though considering the show got taken off the air due to lack of interest, it may not be all too surprising to hear that Ferrera has - at least up until this point - been unsuccessful in that venture. This wasn't the last time that Ferrera was going to find major success when it came to the world of television. If you are interested in checking her out on a regular basis, perhaps you're one of the millions of people who love seeing her in Superstore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Web.Archive</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>)</p><h2 id=jonah-hill---war-dogs><strong>Jonah Hill - War Dogs</strong></h2><p>Everyone has certain vices that they have that they know are not the healthiest for themselves. For Jonah Hill, he&nbsp;knows what one of his biggest factors is when it comes to controlling his weight.</p><p>"It's annoying because when I don't drink beer, I get really really thin. Then when I drink beer, I get a little bigger."</p><p>Hill also gave a shoutout to Channing Tatum when it came to how he lost the weight from War Dogs that as you can see from our photo, saw him put on an extreme amount of extra weight.</p><p><strong>“I called Channing Tatum and said, ‘Hey, if I ate less and go to a trainer, will I get in better shape? And he said, ‘Yes, you dumb [retracted], of </strong>course<strong> you will. It’s the simplest thing in the entire world,” said Hill when discussing his diet on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Hill hasn't come away looking quite as good as Channing Tatum, that is definitely a high bar to try and beat. If you're interested in seeing the heavier-set Hill in War Dogs, then you may also be interested in the performances of Miles Teller and Bradley Cooper, both of whom are also in the film. Todd Phillips also directs it, but it's definitely not the same theme as The Hangover!</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USMagazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>)</p><h2 id=taryn-manning---orange-is-the-new-black><strong>Taryn Manning - Orange Is The New Black</strong></h2><p>When Taryn Manning was cast in Orange Is The New Black, she knew the character that she was going to play was going to probably have a rougher past. But the abundance of illegal drugs that&nbsp;was utilized by Manning's character definitely left her with a lack of attention towards her dental hygiene.</p><p>Manning was interviewed about people's reaction to her smile, leading her to say</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Yeah, people on Twitter are all, “How’d you get those teeth?” And I’m like, You guys, it’s makeup, it’s the result of an amazing makeup department. I went recently, here in L.A., to get a molding of my mouth from a dentist because I’m pretty sure they have something up their sleeve."</strong></p><p>Manning also gave further insight into her thought process behind the transformation,&nbsp;"I just felt so ugly. But then that day was the day I was like, Just go for it. Just go for it. And that’s what I did. I just sort of was like, All right, I look terrible, but she’s just this terrible person. I just made a commitment to it."&nbsp;We're sure Manning was also glad that these teeth weren't something she had to deal with all the time!</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a>)</p><h2 id=nicole-kidman---the-hours><strong>Nicole Kidman - The Hours</strong></h2><p>There are many tremendous performances in Nicole Kidman's career that should make you a huge fan of hers. But her best performance may have come when she was the least recognizable. Kidman spent hours in the makeup chair to help get rid of her good looks for the 2002 film The Hours. It was time that was well worth spending though, as Kidman eventually won the Academy Award for Best Actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The transformation was so startling that Kidman stated she felt it gave her a sense of anonymity back into her life,</p><p>"I did enjoy being anonymous. It was fun to be able to go out of my trailer and not have anyone know me." It was even revealed that the test audience for the film didn't even know it was Kidman in the performance. We're sure when they found out they were left even more impressed by what she was able to accomplish.</p><p>When talking more about the role, Kidman stated, "I felt myself opening up. I've always had a lot of things bubbling inside of me, but for whatever reason I didn't allow them to come out. At the moment I am willing to expose myself and give, like, blood. There's an intensity to the passion."</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SFGate</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>)</p><h2 id=charlize-theron---tully><strong>Charlize Theron - Tully&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Charlize Theron has altered her appearance for a role before to great success when she became the serial killer, Aileen Wuornos. Who to be fair, she probably didn't want to have to look like in real life. Her performance in&nbsp;Monster&nbsp;earned her an Academy Award.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Theron is ditching her traditional good looks again for her most recent role in the film,&nbsp;Tully. Theron stopped by&nbsp;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&nbsp;where she admitted that she ended up putting on upwards of 50 pounds for the role.</p><p><strong>When she was asked to elaborate on what she did to pack on the poundage, she replied that potato chips were her go-to snack,&nbsp;"I had a bag in my car, a bag in the bathroom, a bag in the kitchen, a bag on the couch, a bag in my trailer."</strong></p><p>We wonder what her favorite flavor was? Though when you consider how much weight she added, she probably wasn't all too picky about what the type of chip it was.</p><p>Theron also admitted that along with affecting her physically, her diet had an impact on her mentally,&nbsp;"The hardest thing for me was I wasn't prepared for how that amount of processed food would affect [my] mood.

But hey, at least she wasn't asked to pack on several pounds of fat the way that Rob McElhenney did for one of the seasons. Surface also talked more about the "uglifying" process that she needs to go through, including the fact that the makeup team makes sure to start with her iconic unibrow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also revealed how they will dye her teeth yellow and put yellow splotches all over her face.&nbsp;Huge fans of the series may also find it interesting that she mentioned that due to the makeup team changing, how her unibrow gets styled changes during the series. Now you have something else to look for when watching the series for the 10th+ time!</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SoundCloud</a>)</p><h2 id=elizabeth-banks---the-hunger-games><strong>Elizabeth Banks - The Hunger Games</strong></h2><p>Elizabeth Banks' character takes a less extreme look as the&nbsp;Hunger Games franchise churns along. But when you first get a look at her character in&nbsp;The Hunger Games, you may not be able to believe it's Banks hidden behind those pounds of makeup.</p><p>Not helping is the fact that her beautiful and iconic blonde hair was also left by the wayside for her transformation into Effie Trinket. Nobody would agree with the idea that Elizabeth Banks was nowhere to be found more than Banks herself,</p><p><strong>“I would be in the hair and makeup trailer and I was Elizabeth, and then the wig went on and very suddenly I was Effie. Every day I would have that aha moment, like, ‘We did it! We found Effie!'," said Banks when interviewing with&nbsp;People.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Banks has had many films that we're sure she has been proud of - including a role in Steve Carell's defining film The 40 Year-Old-Virgin -&nbsp;we don't know if she'll ever be able to say she can attach her name to a project that becomes as successful as&nbsp;The Hunger Games&nbsp;franchise was.</p><p>Though if anything is going to stand a chance, it may be the fact that she's coming back for the sequel to the highly successful film,&nbsp;The Lego Movie. While we don't know if there will be as many movies as&nbsp;The Hunger Games&nbsp;managed,&nbsp;working as a voice-over actress may be a lot easier on her schedule.</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheMarySue</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>)</p><h2 id=margot-robbie---queen-of-scots><strong>Margot Robbie - Queen of Scots</strong></h2><p>Margot Robbie has had many films that you have probably seen her in. And even if you haven't seen Suicide Squad, you probably have a pretty good idea of what Margot Robbie looks like when she steps into the short-shorts of Harley Quinn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the film that you may have most recently seen Margot Robbie in, I, Tonya, didn't exactly do much to emphasize the good looks of Robbie. But when you consider she was playing Tonya Harding, it's not like attractiveness was the top quality that they were trying to achieve and the transformation that Robbie went through to become Harding was seriously impressive.</p><p>But if you thought Robbie disappeared into the shoes (or should we say skates) of Tonya Harding, just wait until you see what she has on the horizon. Robbie has completely disappeared into the role of Queen Elizabeth I.</p><p>Robbie will be playing "second fiddle" in the film Mary Queen Of Scots to the very talented Saoirse Ronan. Both Robbie and Ronan were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress this past year. Which means that getting to see both of them in action is sure to be a delight and also means it's a great film to keep an eye on for when the Academy Awards roll around again. Even if you'll have to keep reminding yourself that it's Robbie that you are staring at on the screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki for Queen Of Scots</a>)</p><h2 id=matt-damon---the-informant><strong>Matt Damon - The Informant!</strong></h2><p>When Matt Damon is busting heads in the Bourne Identity franchise, he does so with a body that makes him be considered one of the best looking actors in Hollywood. But those abs were traded in for rolls of fat when Matt Damon agreed to star in the film The Informant!</p><p>When talking about the 30+ pound weight gain for the role, Damon revealed,</p><p><strong>"It was very, very easy to gain the weight. It was very, very fun, probably the </strong>funnest<strong> time I had </strong>working,<strong> because I didn't have to go to the gym after work and I just ate everything I could see. I definitely got doughy."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued with, "I started eating like crazy and drinking dark beer. Between meals on set, I’d eat a No. 1 Value Meal at McDonald’s and then Doritos on top of it. It was absolute heaven."&nbsp;We are sure it was probably a lot easier for Damon to pack on the pounds than it was to shred them off. Especially when it came to the time for him to lose the additional love handles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie came away with a critical score of 79% on Rotten Tomatoes, which means that Damon's efforts for the film were clearly not just limited to the massive change he had to make to his diet!</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyMail</a>)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6osDTq5icrJmrsm6vxKWcm6tdrLWwec%2BlmLJlnqTBbr%2FOZp6op5RiubC7yqKloGWTna6zrcKtnKurXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-attractive-celebs-who-play-not-so-good-looking-characters.html&text=15%20Attractive%20Celebs%20Who%20Play%20Not%20So%20Good%20Looking%20Characters&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-attractive-celebs-who-play-not-so-good-looking-characters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-attractive-celebs-who-play-not-so-good-looking-characters.html&title=15%20Attractive%20Celebs%20Who%20Play%20Not%20So%20Good%20Looking%20Characters" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-attractive-celebs-who-play-not-so-good-looking-characters.html&title=15%20Attractive%20Celebs%20Who%20Play%20Not%20So%20Good%20Looking%20Characters" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-attractive-celebs-who-play-not-so-good-looking-characters.html&title=15%20Attractive%20Celebs%20Who%20Play%20Not%20So%20Good%20Looking%20Characters" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-attractive-celebs-who-play-not-so-good-looking-characters.html&description=15%20Attractive%20Celebs%20Who%20Play%20Not%20So%20Good%20Looking%20Characters" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ben-geurens-wife-children-net-worth-age-height-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Geurens Married, Wife, Child, Net Worth, Earnings, Age, Height, Wiki-Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tulsa-gavin-garman-missing-found.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tulsa Gavin Garman Missing Update 2023: Is He Found Yet?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

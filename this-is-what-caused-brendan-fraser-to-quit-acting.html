Of course, that isn’t the case but because so many people want to become a popular YouTuber, musician, actor, or athlete, it feels like it is. Considering that the powers that be in Hollywood have their pick of the litter, it makes sense that as soon as an actor screws up badly enough they disappear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a lot of cases, famous actors have done something very specific in their personal lives that completely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ruined their careers</a>. However, that isn’t always the case as some Hollywood stars have simply faded away because they appeared in one movie that failed after another.</p><p>When it comes to Brendan Fraser, a lot of people assumed that he largely disappeared from the public eye because he’d headlined too many movies that lost money. While there were some very valid reasons to presume that was the case, it turns out that the reasons why Fraser mostly disappeared are much more complicated than that.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Celebs Whose Careers Can Never Recover</a></span></p><h2 id=rise-to-fame>Rise to Fame</h2><p>Even though the 1992 movie Encino Man doesn’t get talked about much these days, in one way it is an important film. After all, it was the movie that turned Brendan Fraser into a star. Cast as a caveman who is woken up in the ‘90s, Fraser made a character that could have been too goofy a lot of fun to watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the years following the release of the movie that made him a star, Brendan Fraser went on to appear in a slew of other beloved movies. For example, people loved Fraser in the Mummy movies, George of the Jungle, Bedazzled, and Journey to the Center of the Earth. In fact, according to the-numbers.com, in terms of the domestic box office, Fraser was one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-grossing stars of the 2000s</a>.</p><p>In addition to the crowd-pleasing films that Brendan Fraser headlined, he also proved himself to be a wonderful actor in a pair of films that deserve to be talked about more. One of the stars of the Oscar-nominated movie Gods and Monsters, Fraser wasn’t in the running for a major award himself but he was excellent in the film. Sadly, a lot of people have forgotten about the 1992 movie School Ties which is a real shame since Fraser was so spectacular in that film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Stars Who Seemingly Disappeared From Hollywood (Out Of Nowhere)</a></span></p><h2 id=career-decline>Career Decline</h2><p>On top of the fact that some famous actors have seen their career fall apart due to their naughty behavior, some stars have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disappeared due to a single role</a>. In the case of Brendan Fraser, there is no denying that he headlined several movies that simply missed the mark.</p><p>After ruling at the box office during the early-2000s, Brendan Fraser began to star in notoriously bad movies like Extraordinary Measures and Furry Vengeance. Worse yet, most of the movies that Fraser starred in during the late-2000s and early-2010s have been forgotten by virtually everyone. With all of that in mind, when Fraser mostly disappeared from the spotlight for many years, a lot of people blamed that on all of those projects. However, Fraser later revealed something much more sinister played a major role in his career decline.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Beloved ’90s Stars Who Vanished Into Thin Air</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=devastating-incident>Devastating Incident</h2><p>A few years ago, Brendan Fraser began to mount a comeback after he took a role in the show Trust. When that show was released in 2018, Fraser was called upon to take part in a slew of interviews to promote the series. Of course, when most actors interact with the press, they spend their time singing the praises of their latest project. However, in 2018, Fraser made the brave decision to talk about something that deeply affected him and inspired him to step out of the spotlight.</p><p>While taking part in a GQ profile, Brendan Fraser revealed that when he attended a luncheon held by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was assaulted</a>. According to the former HFPA president Philip Berk, he called Fraser over while both were at the event and he pinched the actor’s butt in jest. However, according to what Fraser told the GQ interviewer, Berk did a lot more than just grab his butt and the sexual assault left Brendan feeling sick, like a little kid, and wanting to cry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the days, weeks, and months after that incident, Brendan Fraser was deeply affected by what had been done to him. Talking about the aftermath during the aforementioned GQ profile, Fraser said he “became depressed” and that he wanted to “retreat”. On top of feeling “reclusive”, Brendan also began to wonder if the Hollywood Foreign Press Association had blacklisted him since he no longer was invited to events like the Golden Globes. Worse yet, Fraser began to question “who (he) was and what (he) was doing” as he felt like his career had “withered on the vine”.</p><p>Years after the incident took place, Brendan Fraser watched the Times Up and Me Too movements take place and was amazed. “I watched this wonderful movement, these people with the courage to say what I didn't have the courage to say.” Likely inspired by his peers, it doesn’t seem like a coincidence that in the months that followed Fraser made his mainstream return to acting and spoke out himself. That is a great thing all around, especially when you remember that since Fraser spoke about what happened to him, other stars have also shared their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stories of abuse</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Corey Haim Case: Corey Feldman Names Charlie Sheen As An Abuser</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0edahmK1lk5bCtLHDZpmrnZ6Zrq95xauYrJ2iYsGwedCuoK1lkZjBqrrGaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthis-is-what-caused-brendan-fraser-to-quit-acting.html&text=This%20Is%20What%20Caused%20Brendan%20Fraser%20To%20Quit%20Acting&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-is-what-caused-brendan-fraser-to-quit-acting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-what-caused-brendan-fraser-to-quit-acting.html&title=This%20Is%20What%20Caused%20Brendan%20Fraser%20To%20Quit%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthis-is-what-caused-brendan-fraser-to-quit-acting.html&title=This%20Is%20What%20Caused%20Brendan%20Fraser%20To%20Quit%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-what-caused-brendan-fraser-to-quit-acting.html&title=This%20Is%20What%20Caused%20Brendan%20Fraser%20To%20Quit%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-is-what-caused-brendan-fraser-to-quit-acting.html&description=This%20Is%20What%20Caused%20Brendan%20Fraser%20To%20Quit%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tiktok-what-is-the-fruit-roll-up-trick-and-how-to-do-it-trend-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TikTok: What Is The Fruit Roll Up Trick And How To Do It?

While his very large family of 12 kids from six different mothers has inspired many memes and jokes, he has still shown that he’s a present dad to his kids. He posted some adorable photos from his second youngest child&nbsp;<strong>Rise’s&nbsp;</strong>first birthday on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on Tuesday, October 3. In the adorable photos, he smiled with Rise’s older sister&nbsp;<strong>Powerful Queen, </strong>and both of their mom <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brittany Bell</strong></a>. “Big Rizzy Day,” he wrote in the caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The comedian <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed his 12th child</a>, <strong>Halo</strong>, with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alyssa Scott</strong></a> in Dec. 2022 just a few weeks after he and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong></a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gave birth</a> to their third child, <strong>Beautiful Zeppelin</strong>.&nbsp;While this might raise an eyebrow for some, the 42-year-old musician and host has previously stated that all of his pregnancies — including having multiple in one year — have been planned. In a July 2021 interview on his podcast, Nick told the rap duo City Girls that he was having children “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on purpose</a>.” He confirmed, “Trust me, there’s a lot of people I could’ve gotten pregnant that I didn’t,” he said. “The ones that got pregnant are the ones that were supposed to get pregnant.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In an August 2021 appearance on The Breakfast Club,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Wild ‘N Out host revealed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his views on marriage</a> and defended his large and growing family. “Just the idea that a man should have one woman, we shouldn’t have anything. I have no ownership over this person. If we’re really talking about how we coexist and how we populate, it’s about what exchange can we create together? I’ve never really subscribed to that mentality,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nick-Cannon-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>He further defended himself in June 2022 and claimed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he is a super “involved” and attentive parent</a>. “Contrary to popular belief, I’m probably engaged throughout my children’s day, more often than the average adult can be,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Men’s Health&nbsp;</a>for their May-June issue. “If I’m not physically in the same city with my kids, I’m talking to them before they go to school via FaceTime and stuff. And then when I am [in the same city, I’m] driving my kids to school, like making sure I pick ’em up.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Plus, a person close to the singer revealed to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> women who have birthed Nick’s children</a> are satisfied with the unorthodox situation. “All the women he has children with are kept in the loop and informed each time he has another baby on the way,” they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>explained to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>&nbsp;EXCLUSIVELY</a>. “He has open communication with all of them. Nick has always believed transparency is important. It would not be fair to the mothers of his kids, nor to the kids themselves.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Nick also again expressed his excitement over his kids, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in a PEOPLE&nbsp;interview</a> in May 2023. “I’m so excited about all my kids,” he said.&nbsp;“Constantly, from every aspect of it. From them getting citizen of the month awards in the first grade to the birth of the new ones. Every day I just wake up excited as a father.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Read on to learn about each one of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Masked Singer</a>&nbsp;host’s children.</p><h2>Beautiful Zeppelin</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>On Nov. 12, 2022, Nick and Abby announced they had<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> given birth</a> to Beautiful Zeppelin. &nbsp;“<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">11/11/2022 A BEAUTIFUL DAY for “<strong>BEAUTIFUL</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ZEPPELIN CANNON</strong>” to arrive! Mommy&nbsp;@hiabbydelarosa you make it ALL look so easy and effortless but I am forever indebted to your tireless work of constant dedication, diligent effort and selfless love that you give to our children and myself,” Nick wrote in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a post.&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2>Rise Messiah</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Nick took to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on Sept. 30, 2022 to announce he and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Brittany Bell</strong> </a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed their third child together</a> on September 23, 2022. Alongside a video of Brittany’s lavish baby shower, Nick gushed, “Another Blessing!!! As my journey on this planet becomes more and more remarkable and unfathomable, all I can do is thank God and continue to ask the Most High to order my steps. He has given me stewardship and dominion over a family dynamic that to some is unimaginable. But more importantly he has blessed me with loving individuals to guide me with care through this purposeful life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>He then raved about how lucky he is to enjoy this parenting journey with Brittany. “I am so indebted and grateful for the matriarch energy in my time of need. @missbbell has been the rock and foundation of my Fatherhood journey,” he stated. “She has taught me so much about parenting, psychology, spirituality, love and just life in general. For our third child she told me she didn’t want a baby shower and needed NOTHING! All she desired was PRAYER from her authentic Loved Ones! I am learning that is the best GIFT! She introduced me to the concept of a BlessingWay!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>He also noted the delivery was “probably the most difficult labor and delivery” he “ever witnessed!” He concluded, “48 hours of excruciating pain and life risking danger to welcome 10 pounds of Love and joy named RISE MESSIAH CANNON.”</p><h2>Onyx</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Nick announced the birth of his ninth child, and his first with photographer <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>LaNisha Cole</strong></a>, on Sept. 15, 2022. The pair posed with their <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter <strong>Onyx</strong></a> at the hospital in a photo that Nick shared on Instagram. “I vow to protect, provide, guide and love this child to the best of my abilities,” he sweetly wrote. “I promise to love this little girl with all my heart, regardless what anyone says. I’ve given up on attempting to define myself for the world or society but instead I’m doing the work to heal and grow into the infinite Being God ordained me to be. Hopefully I can teach Onyx the same, to not let others shame or ridicule her with their outside opinions.”</p><h2>Legendary Love</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bre-Tiesi-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>In late Jan. 2022, there were rumblings that the prolific star would<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> be a father for the eighth time</a> after photos of Nick attending model <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bre Tiesi</strong></a>‘s baby shower and sex reveal party in Malibu, Calif., surfaced on the internet. Nick confirmed the newest addition to his growing family on the Jan. 31 during an episode of The Nick Cannon Show. The host joked that he was “starting his own football team” and that <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rihanna</a></strong>—&nbsp;who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced she was pregnant</a> with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>A$AP&nbsp;Rocky</strong></a>‘s child in a series of photos — was not carrying his baby. Nick also confirmed the baby’s sex (“It’s a boy! We found out yesterday,” he exclaimed) and proposed names for the new child, including Miracle, Confetti, Purpose, Immaculate, and Chosen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Nick and Bre’s son <strong>Legendary Love</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was born</a> in July 2022, after Bre went through an “all natural unmedicated home birth” that she described on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Bre was previously married to ex-NFL quarterback <strong>Johnny Manziel</strong>. The couple divorced in November 2021.</p><h2>Zen</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21>Nick’s son <strong>Zen</strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;was born</a> to model&nbsp;Alyssa Scott in June 2021. It was their first child together, but Nick’s seventh overall. Shortly after the little guy was born, his dad took to his Instagram Story to share a professional <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>newborn shot</a> of him and wrote, “Introducing Zen.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>On December 7, 2021, Nick sadly announced on The Nick Cannon Show&nbsp;that Zen <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had died of a brain tumor</a> at five months old. He sobbed as he shared the news with his listeners, revealing that the brain tumor started to grow quickly at the end of November. Zen<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> died on Dec. 5, 2021</a> shortly after taking a trip to the beach. Nick was there when his son passed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Although Alyssa and Nick are not expecting a new bundle of joy, Zen’s memory will never be forgotten. Alyssa frequently posts tributes to him on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> page, such as on what would have been his first birthday. Alongside <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>several clips</a> of her late son, an emotional Alyssa said, “At the root of all the emotions I have today there is insurmountable love. I always try my best to remain positive but right now I can’t help but cry out ‘it’s not suppose to be like this’. In my mind I can see him smashing his cake and crawling around, tugging at my legs. But the reality is I will be the one to blow out his first candle. I will be wishing he was still here with us. GO REST HIGH.”</p><h2>Zion</h2><p id=content-paragraph-24>Nick became a father for the fifth and sixth time in June 2021 with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Abby De La Rosa</a></strong>, who announced that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she’d given birth</a> to twin boys, <strong>Zion&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Zillion</strong>, via Instagram “Welcome to the world Zion Mixolydian Cannon & Zillion Heir Cannon,” she wrote alongside a photo of her holding her newborn sons in her arms in the hospital, as seen below.</p><h2>Zillion</h2><p id=content-paragraph-27>Zillion, of course, is Zion’s twin brother. Abby enjoys sharing photos of her little ones online, as exemplified by her Instagram page. When the twins turned one month old, she shared a few <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>adorable pictures</a> her and Nick cuddling and kissing the boys while lying in bed. And in an adorable post to her Instagram Story in June 2022, Nick was seen spending quality time with the boys by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dancing and encouraging them to walk</a>. In one clip, Zion let out an adorable squeal of delight as Nick and Abby laughed with joy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-28>Later in the summer, Nick, Abby, Zillion, and Zion spent some more family time at a butterfly habit, as seen in the precious post below. “Today, we Immersed ourselves in the lives of over 200 beautiful tropical butterflies. If I had to use one word to describe the experience it would be nothing less than MAGICAL!! Thank you @scbgarden This outing was one I’ll remember forever,” Abby gushed in the caption.</p><h2>Powerful Queen</h2><p id=content-paragraph-33>In December 2020, Brittany <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed her second child</a> with Nick:&nbsp;<strong>Powerful Queen</strong>. Powerful is Nick’s second daughter, and the pair seemed very excited about having the baby during the holiday season, as their birth announcement was holiday-themed and showed Nick dressed up in a Santa outfit. “The best gift ever,” she wrote in the announcement caption. “we have been surprised with… A GIRL!!!!! … Powerful Queen Cannon … came this week perfect timing for Christmas. So much more to share. All I can say is that Nick was my rock through the most intense yet empowering natural water birth. It was nothing but POWERFUL” She concluded, “Merry Christmas!!!! THANK YOU GOD”.</p><h2>Golden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nick-Cannon-Kids-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-34>After<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Nick and Mariah divorced</a> in 2016, he started dating model Brittany, who gave birth to their son <strong>Golden </strong>in Feb. 2017. Brittany shares tons of photos of the little boy on Instagram, and it seems like he takes after his dad’s sense of humor and natural showmanship, as the doting mother often shares clips of him <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>acting silly</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>striking poses</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-35>Other than acting silly, Golden seems to enjoy sports. In June 2021, Brittany posted a photo of the boy in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>little league baseball uniform</a>. “Look out Big leagues! Our Wee Baller is movin up! Congratulations to my baby boy for his outstanding performance on the field!!! His arm is already fierce! It’s true he’s THE GOLDEN CANNON!!” she raved in the caption.</p><h2>Monroe</h2><p id=content-paragraph-36>Nick’s first kids, twins <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Monroe</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Moroccan</strong></a>, were born in April 2011 to him and then-wife,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mariah Carey</a></strong>. Monroe has followed her parents’ footsteps into the entertainment industry and impressively landed<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> her first modeling campaign</a> in July 2021 at the age of 10. She showed off some of OshKosh B’gosh’s back-to-school line in the campaign and looked adorable as she transformed into a 10-year-old version of her famous mother. Monroe has also made a few appearances in her mom’s Christmas specials and documentaries, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> IMDb.</a></p><h2>Moroccan</h2><p id=content-paragraph-37>Moroccan is Monroe’s twin brother. Like his sister, he’s also appeared in his mom’s Mariah Carey’s Magical Christmas Special and lent his voice for her 2017 video for “All I Want For Christmas Is You,” per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. Like their mom, Monroe and Moroccan both enjoy singing. Despite having some of the most famous parents, an insider told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY in Feb. 2020 that they live a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>relatively normal life</a>. “The kids do a lot of things together. They have several activities they do. They’re also into sports like karate. They are very well-rounded, kind kids, and both are quiet and shy a lot of the time, too. They’re also very studious, and they both get really good grades. They are actually pretty strict parents and keep them on a very strict schedule. They’re very normal kids,” they explained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme82imqRlk5a7r7vNZqKinKNigXZ8k2xtbWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnick-cannon-kids-4504364.html&text=Everything%20to%20Know%20About%20His%2012%20Kids%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnick-cannon-kids-4504364.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnick-cannon-kids-4504364.html&title=Everything%20to%20Know%20About%20His%2012%20Kids%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnick-cannon-kids-4504364.html&title=Everything%20to%20Know%20About%20His%2012%20Kids%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnick-cannon-kids-4504364.html&title=Everything%20to%20Know%20About%20His%2012%20Kids%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnick-cannon-kids-4504364.html&description=Everything%20to%20Know%20About%20His%2012%20Kids%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gloria-trevi-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gloria Trevi Net Worth  How Much is Trevi Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./watch-chris-rock-says-kanye-west-might-exceed-jay-z-best-rapper-all-time-245614.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Rock Says Kanye West Might Exceed Jay Z As The Best Rapper Of All Time">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

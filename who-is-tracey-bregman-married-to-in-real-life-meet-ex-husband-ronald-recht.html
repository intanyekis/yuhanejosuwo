As a result, he was handed a restraining order from the court and was not allowed to be within 100 yards of Brian.</p><p>Likewise, his hate towards Brian was so much that he even planned to sabotage Tracey’s relationship with Brian, reports&nbsp;TMZ.</p><p>Apart from this, Tracey tried to maintain a healthy relationship with her boyfriend. But it was for naught, and the two ended their bond in May 2018.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tracey-bregman-is-blessed-with-two-kids></span>Tracey Bregman Is Blessed With Two Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tracey Bregman children are Austin Alexander Recht and Landon Recht.

Landon was born on 18th October 1996.</p><p>The youngest Recht is interested in giving a shot at acting. Tracey believes that he is a talented individual and can leave an impact on the industry.</p><p>However, Landon’s mom suggests her son have a plan B as the show business is very competitive. Even the best talents crumble under pressure.</p><p>Landon loves horses and shares a unique bond with their family horse. He and the family’s horse, Standing Ovation, have the same birthday month. His mother wished them on their birthdays and reminded everyone of the age difference between the two.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ytqZqbla56o77EoKSapl2irrO%2ByJ6bZqyfYravedGemKVlnJ6zpnnMnpytZZWteqnB0puYp5xdp7yvrcudZKudk53BcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-tracey-bregman-married-to-in-real-life-meet-ex-husband-ronald-recht.html&text=Who%20Is%20Tracey%20Bregman%20Married%20To%20In%20Real%20Life%3f%20Meet%20Ex%20Husband%20Ronald%20Recht&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-tracey-bregman-married-to-in-real-life-meet-ex-husband-ronald-recht.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-tracey-bregman-married-to-in-real-life-meet-ex-husband-ronald-recht.html&title=Who%20Is%20Tracey%20Bregman%20Married%20To%20In%20Real%20Life%3f%20Meet%20Ex%20Husband%20Ronald%20Recht" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-tracey-bregman-married-to-in-real-life-meet-ex-husband-ronald-recht.html&title=Who%20Is%20Tracey%20Bregman%20Married%20To%20In%20Real%20Life%3f%20Meet%20Ex%20Husband%20Ronald%20Recht" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-tracey-bregman-married-to-in-real-life-meet-ex-husband-ronald-recht.html&title=Who%20Is%20Tracey%20Bregman%20Married%20To%20In%20Real%20Life%3f%20Meet%20Ex%20Husband%20Ronald%20Recht" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-tracey-bregman-married-to-in-real-life-meet-ex-husband-ronald-recht.html&description=Who%20Is%20Tracey%20Bregman%20Married%20To%20In%20Real%20Life%3f%20Meet%20Ex%20Husband%20Ronald%20Recht" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./21-jump-street-actress-brittney-algers-wiki-pitch-perfect-married-husband-bio-550227-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="21 Jump Street actress Brittney Algers Wiki: Pitch Perfect, Married, Husband, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rebecca-staab-biography-age-movies-and-tv-shows-husband-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is the Net Worth of Rebecca Staab?

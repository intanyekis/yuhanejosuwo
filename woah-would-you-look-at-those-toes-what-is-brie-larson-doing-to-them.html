The award-winning 30-year old California native took on the role of Carol Danvers for the 2019 Captain Marvel film, but it earned a mix of praises and criticism. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some Marvel fans even think the actress ought to be replaced.</a> Not even her Best Actress award for the 2015 drama/thriller film Room&nbsp;and all the other accolades she has earned since starting her acting career in the 90s, have shielded her from the critics saying that Marvel has to find another actress to play the coveted role of Captain Marvel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Facts About Brie Larson's Rise To Fame</a></span></p><h2 id=toes-in-the-spotlight>Toes in the Spotlight</h2><p>While acting critics may be a part of the usual challenges for celebrities, Larson has also been in the spotlight for her unusual physical attributes, more specifically, her feet. Reddit and 9Gag users have consistently posted photos of her toes peeking out from under her stunning red-carpet dresses, commenting how one toe in particular is a bit longer and that her toe nails may have some sort of fungal infection. The gender-rights activist has been twitted a lot about not taking care of her toes with some fans blatantly saying she should at least get a proper pedicure and maybe visit a doctor to deal with the issue. Other comments also suggest she should instead cover up her feet with closed shoes and not parade them in red carpet events. This may be quite the dilemma though. If the Captain Marvel actress is indeed suffering from a fungal infection, then she was probably advised by her doctor to wear open shoes to prevent moisture from making things worse down there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos From Brie Larson's Instagram That Are Too Good To Ignore</a></span></p><h2 id=the-2020-oscars>The 2020 Oscars</h2><p>It was a big night for Hollywood when the Oscars 2020 Awards was celebrated last February 9 at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. The lucky winners included the South <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Movie Parasite</a> for best picture, Joaquin Phoenix taking home the best actor award for Joker and Renee Zellweger bagging the best actress award for her coming back role as Judy Garland in the biopic Judy. To top it off, there was a surprise performance by 90's rap god <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem singing "Lose Yourself",</a> the song that earned him an Oscar Award for Best Music for the film 8 Mile back in 2003. Everybody in attendance was dressed to the nines, and Brie Larson was no exception. She was a vision in her champagne-colored Hedi Slimane V-neck full length gown as she walked the red carpet to support her film Avengers: Endgame. The Marvel movie was nominated for Best Visual Effects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Actresses Who Would've Made a Better Captain Marvel Than Brie Larson</a></p><h2 id=all-that-glam>All That Glam</h2><p>The Swarovski-encrusted gown was a stunner, all hand sewn with crystals, sequins and glass beads. The matching cape and thigh-high slit was toned down with a neat updo, Bulgari drop earrings, Serpenti rings and a single-band bracelet. But Los Angeles-based celebrity stylist Samantha McMillen, could have been more thorough though. The champagne-colored Jimmy Choo heels Larson wore with the dress, couldn't take the attention away from the prying eyes that zoomed in on her unkempt toes. Yes, the toes were a real deal-breaker. And with cameras everywhere, a close up of her unsightly digits soon made the rounds of social media again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-s-well-that-ends-well>All's Well That Ends Well</h2><p>However, fans have been speculating if the actress finally got around to having her toes fixed. In her latest red carpet appearance for the Avengers:Endgame premiere last April 22, in the Los Angeles Convention Center in Downtown LA, a noticeable change can be seen with her now infamous feet teasing the spotlight. Wearing another gown by Celine, the actress paired the sexy low-cut, spaghetti-strapped pale purple satin number with statement jewelry from Irene Neuwirth. The infinity rings she wore on all five fingers were inspired by the Endgame movie and represented Mind, Power, Reality, Soul, Space and Time. But it wasn't the Christian Louboutin Loubi Queen heels that stole the show. Clipped, polished and properly fitted to her metallic sandals, her freshly pedicured digits were the star of the night. Well, at least for the fans who keep on zooming in on her feet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just to be clear though, the pictures of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larson on the 2020 Oscars</a> showed her posing with her right feet exposed, while the more recent pictures in the Endgame premiere were angled to the left side. Maybe her toes are not in such a bad shape after all, nothing a quick trip to the salon can't fix. We wait with bated breath for another red carpet moment with Larson to confirm this. Until then, her legendary toes will keep on haunting many more Reddit users to come.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brie Larson Used To Be A Club DJ Before Captain Marvel</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuqJmYYsSwwcudZLKnpWK5sLvKZpitZaSdvLSxjK2mnqtdrLWiwIyiqmaaop6ybrjAq6qopl2ZvKq6xmarqGWknbKuew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwoah-would-you-look-at-those-toes-what-is-brie-larson-doing-to-them.html&text=Woah%20Would%20You%20Look%20At%20Those%20Toes%3f%20What%20is%20Brie%20Larson%20Doing%20To%20Them%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwoah-would-you-look-at-those-toes-what-is-brie-larson-doing-to-them.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwoah-would-you-look-at-those-toes-what-is-brie-larson-doing-to-them.html&title=Woah%20Would%20You%20Look%20At%20Those%20Toes%3f%20What%20is%20Brie%20Larson%20Doing%20To%20Them%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwoah-would-you-look-at-those-toes-what-is-brie-larson-doing-to-them.html&title=Woah%20Would%20You%20Look%20At%20Those%20Toes%3f%20What%20is%20Brie%20Larson%20Doing%20To%20Them%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwoah-would-you-look-at-those-toes-what-is-brie-larson-doing-to-them.html&title=Woah%20Would%20You%20Look%20At%20Those%20Toes%3f%20What%20is%20Brie%20Larson%20Doing%20To%20Them%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwoah-would-you-look-at-those-toes-what-is-brie-larson-doing-to-them.html&description=Woah%20Would%20You%20Look%20At%20Those%20Toes%3f%20What%20is%20Brie%20Larson%20Doing%20To%20Them%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amazon-black-friday-home-sauna-red-light-and-cryotherapy-deals.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amazon Black Friday: Home Sauna, Red Light and Cryotherapy Deals">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-owns-big-motoring-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Owns Big Motoring World?

She shocked parents everywhere by wearing a provocative Catholic school girl uniform in her first video "...Baby One More Time." She became a teen icon of that time, experiencing an amount of success unheard of for someone her age.At the same time, Melissa Joan Hart was starring in the sitcom Sabrina the Teenage Witch. She was also filming the teen movie Drive Me Crazy, which was about to be released.The two stars' paths would cross during this time, as they collaborated on several different projects. Hart has often spoken about the time she spent with Spears over the years. They even reunited at Spears' Las Vegas show many years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=melissa-joan-hart-took-britney-to-her-first-nightclub-when-she-was-underage>Melissa Joan Hart Took Britney To Her First Nightclub When She Was Underage</h2><p>Spears was singing and dancing from the time she was a child. She went from performing in local fairs to making her television debut on Star Search. Although Spears didn't win the competition, she definitely made an impression.</p><p>As she entered her pre-teens, Spears joined the cast of The All-New Mickey Mouse Club. She eventually pursued a music career. After being rejected by several big labels, Spears was signed by Jive Records.</p><p>Spears was then thrown into a whirlwind of recording, rehearsing, and promoting. Hart spent some time with Spears during this period and saw firsthand the pressure she was under. <a href=#>While speaking on the show Bethenny</a>, Hart told a story of how she took Spears to her first club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar41795668.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She was young and I could see the stress on her face," Hart said. "I was like, 'Do you want to got lunch?' and she was like, 'Yes, yes. Let's go to lunch,' and then someone behind her would go, 'No, no, no. You have interviews you have to go to vocal coaching, you have to go to the gym and then you have to go on your tour.' And she was like, 'Okay, maybe later.' And I was like, 'Let's go to dinner tonight.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Melissa Joan Hart's Career Basically Ended In The 2000s</a></span></p><p>She continued, "So I went to her hotel and I invited her to come out with me and we went to a club. She was underage so I snuck her in the back door and we did a little dancing and then people sort of swarmed on top of her and then she got stuck at a table hanging out with people, chit chatting and I was like, 'I've got to go to work tomorrow can I go?' And she was like, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, go I am good.

The song was featured in the movie and Hart appeared with Spears in the video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hart later admitted that she didn't like the idea of the film being named after Spears' song. <a href=#>While speaking to Bustle</a>, she said that she didn't think Spears' career would last very long. Obviously, her prediction was incorrect.</p><p>"I tried to fight Fox on that," Hart said. "I was like, 'Some little teenybopper's gonna come in and rename our movie? She's gonna be a flash in the pan, nobody's gonna remember her in five years and then our movie's gonna be named after her song.' I was a little wrong."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar29759353.jpg><p>Hart was also starring on the hit sitcom Sabrina the Teenage Witch, which aired on ABC.

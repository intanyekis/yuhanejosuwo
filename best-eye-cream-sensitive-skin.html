Finding a top-quality eye cream that targets your concerns without causing irritation can be challenging if you have sensitive skin. Thankfully, there are plenty of great options on the market that are crafted to give the skin the support it needs without triggering inflammation. After analyzing the various options on the market, we’ve created the ultimate guide to the best eye creams for sensitive skin.</p><h2><strong>What to Look For in an Eye Cream – and What to Avoid</strong></h2><p>Let’s first talk about the eye-cream ingredients you should avoid if you have sensitive skin. We recommend skipping formulas containing fragrances (especially synthetic ones) or alcohol. Alcohol will cause dryness in sensitive skin (which often is already prone to being dry), while fragrances can cause irritation in both the skin and the eyes.</p><p>Those with sensitive skin should practice caution with products containing retinol. Many anti-aging eye creams on the market are made with this vitamin A derivative, as it is one of the most effective ingredients for softening fine lines and wrinkles and enhancing firmness and elasticity. However, it also has a high risk of causing irritation and dryness, which can be especially problematic for easily aggravated complexions.</p><p>If you’re desperate to try a retinol eye cream, we recommend choosing a low-concentration formula that also contains soothing and moisturizing ingredients to help counteract negative side effects. Alternatively, you can try a bakuchiol eye cream. Bakuchiol is a plant-derived ingredient that is considered to be a gentler alternative to retinol.</p><p>If you are looking to address signs of aging, there are other ingredients that are typically better tolerated by sensitive skin. In addition to bakuchiol, we recommend looking for formulas with vitamin C or peptides. These ingredients can help promote more youthful eyes.</p><p>We also suggest reaching for antioxidant-rich formulas. Antioxidants protect the skin from the harmful effects of free radicals, which can cause skin damage and premature signs of aging. Antioxidant-packed ingredients include vitamin E and green tea extract.</p><p>Anyone prone to dark circles can benefit from eye creams infused with ingredients like caffeine and ginseng, which can help brighten and depuff for more energized eyes. Additionally, we recommend reaching for formulas with hydrating ingredients to plump and soften the skin around the eye area. Ceramides, hyaluronic acid, sodium hyaluronate, shea butter, squalane and glycerin are all excellent options.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, we suggest looking for clean formulas. We particularly recommend formulas made without ingredients like parabens and phthalates, as those chemicals have the potential to irritate the skin.</p><h2><strong>The Best Eye Creams for Sensitive Skin</strong></h2><p>Ready to take your skincare routine to the next level? Here’s the ultimate list of the best eye creams for sensitive skin. No matter your specific concerns or budget, you’ll find at least one option that works perfectly for your needs.</p><h3><strong>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Eye Stick</a></strong></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image1-28.png alt="Blu Atlas Eye Stick" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The Blu Atlas Eye Stick is packed with nutrient-dense, high-quality ingredients that target signs of aging, dark circles and puffiness. These ingredients (96% of which are naturally derived) are able to deliver visible results without aggravating sensitive skin. The formula is vegan and cruelty-free, and doesn’t contain fragrances, parabens or phthalates, so you can feel safe using it in your routine.</p><p>This formula is crafted with <i>Coffea canephora</i> seed extract (which is packed with caffeine) and niacinamide, which work together to brighten dark circles for a more energized appearance. These ingredients are joined by ascorbic acid, a potent form of vitamin C that further works to lighten dark circles while stimulating collagen production to reduce visible signs of aging. It also provides antioxidant benefits, ensuring the eye area is optimally protected against the damaging effects of free radicals.</p><p>Palmitoyl tripeptide-5 (an effective peptide) helps soften fine lines and wrinkles while firming the skin, promoting a younger-looking eye area. Soothing rose flower water also reduces puffiness. Additionally, nutrient-rich algae extract strengthens the skin, while squalane, sodium hyaluronate and panthenol plump the eye area with moisture, promoting a softer feel and smoother look.

Vitamin C (in the form of ascorbic acid) provides additional anti-aging benefits. It also brightens dark circles and adds protective antioxidant benefits.</p><p>Another key ingredient in this formula is caffeine, which helps alleviate puffiness and dark circles. Additionally, algae works to nourish the skin as it boosts firmness, while sodium hyaluronate, glycerin and squalane boost moisture levels.</p><p>Like other Alpyn Beauty products, this eye cream is infused with ingredients derived from sustainably harvested plants around Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

After four weeks of using the eye cream, 100% of participants agreed that the skin around their eyes felt calm, refreshed, hydrated and nourished throughout the day, while 96% agreed that it was the perfect daily eye cream to use alone or under makeup.</p><p>This eye cream has a clean formula that has been dermatologist tested.

Additionally, the formula contains a 10% concentration of glycerin to draw moisture to the skin and lock it in for long-term hydration.</p><p>What makes this eye gel stand out is the eco-conscious packaging.

Some may prefer only to use their eye cream at night, especially if they’ve chosen a thick formula. With consistent daily usage, you’ll be able to get the best results from your eye cream.</p><p>The one big caveat here is to do with retinol eye creams. These should only be used in the evening, since retinol can increase the skin’s sensitivity to UV rays and degrades when exposed to the sun. For those with sensitive skin, nightly usage may be too aggressive, even when using a formula with a lower concentration of retinol. It’s best to start with application every other night to see how it works with your skin. Bakuchiol-powered formulas can typically be used daily, but pay attention to how your skin reacts to your product of choice, and adjust accordingly.</p><h3><strong>Should you use an eye cream in the morning or at night?</strong></h3><p>As mentioned above, most eye creams can be used both morning and night, except for retinol eye creams. If you wear makeup, you might find that heavier eye cream is best used as part of your nighttime routine, as the formula may cause mascara, concealer and other cosmetics to smudge. If you’d still like to use an eye product during the day, go for a lightweight cream, gel or serum-based eye cream.</p><h3><strong>What is the best way to apply eye cream?</strong></h3><p>Take a small amount of the product on your ring finger, and then gently tap it underneath the eyes and up to the brow bone. The ring finger gives you the gentlest application, which is essential since the skin underneath the eyes is extra delicate. If you’re using an eye cream that comes with an applicator (like a rollerball), you can use that to apply the product. Just ensure you aren’t putting too much pressure on the eye area.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For the best results, be sure to apply an eye cream at the right point in your routine. We recommend applying your eye cream after cleansing, serums, and moisturizer. At night, this means it will be the very last product in your routine (although, if you also use a facial oil, you’ll want to apply your eye cream first). In the morning, you should apply your eye cream before you put on sunscreen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2axqZ5wqucmqVdqLKvv8itoK%2BdXai4qrqO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-eye-cream-sensitive-skin.html&text=The%20Best%20Eye%20Creams%20for%20Sensitive%20Skin&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-eye-cream-sensitive-skin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-eye-cream-sensitive-skin.html&title=The%20Best%20Eye%20Creams%20for%20Sensitive%20Skin" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-eye-cream-sensitive-skin.html&title=The%20Best%20Eye%20Creams%20for%20Sensitive%20Skin" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-eye-cream-sensitive-skin.html&title=The%20Best%20Eye%20Creams%20for%20Sensitive%20Skin" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-eye-cream-sensitive-skin.html&description=The%20Best%20Eye%20Creams%20for%20Sensitive%20Skin" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dabria-aguilar.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dabria Aguilar">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rambo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Rambo>Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

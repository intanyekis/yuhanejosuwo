He joined the Broadway cast of <i>Over Here!</i> and became a traveling cast member for the musical <i>Grease</i>. The actor spent the early years of the 1970s starring in various projects, and his two most famous roles occurred in 1977 and 1998 with <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> and <i>Grease</i>. At just 24 years of age, <a href=#>he received his first Oscar nomination and became one of the youngest actors to receive worldwide recognition for his talent</a>. With his appearances in films and television, John Travolta has amassed a <a href=#>massive $250 million fortune over the years.</a></p><p>Along with being a talented actor and singer, John Travolta is also a licensed pilot who owns a fleet of jets, with one of them often parked in the hangar outside his home. From business jets to airlines, the actor has a stunning collection of planes he loves to fly to reach locations. Let’s take a look inside one of his private jets.</p><h2 id=a-love-for-flying>A Love For Flying</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Ever since he was a child, John Travolta developed an interest in flying</a> and began learning when he was 15. In 1978, he received his first pilot license, which helped him bring his aviation dreams to life. The actor owned seven private planes, including a Bombardier Challenger 601, Boeing 707, Boeing 727, and three Gulfstream jets. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, Travolta already has a license to fly a 707 and 724, and he received his third license to fly the 737. He announced via Instagram as he shared a photo of himself seated in a 737.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Amazon Air: Inside Jeff Bezos’ Insane $150 Million Private Jets</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the President of Constellation Productions, Inc, John Travolta has used his business to produce movies and, as a registration name to buy his airlines. Each of his private aircraft is registered under the company as a property of the actor. In 2019, the actor made a rare appearance on Jay Leno’s popular automobile show <i>Jay Leno’s Garage</i>, wherein he gave a tour of a Boeing 737-inspired aircraft to eager viewers. His Boeing business jet retails upwards of $57 million and comes with an additional cost of $20 million for its interior renovation and upkeep.</p><h2 id=luxurious-and-fast>Luxurious And Fast</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travolta’s Boeing Business Jet was constructed in 2010 with Jet Tech’s exterior and registered as YG128. The airstairs lead directly to the entrance of the expansive open-plan area fitted with leather recliner seats. While the original business jet has a seating capacity of 150 passengers, Travolta has customized the flight to seat 15 people in luxurious seats. A large television is situated for in-flight entertainment and dining spaces for meals. It also has two bedrooms for comfort with an ensuite bathroom and shower, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Movies</a>. The owner’s suite has soft furnishings, a wall-mounted television, and a queen-sized bed. Along with the bathroom, there is a stylish vanity space to dress up before landing.</p><p>The performance of the jet is extraordinary due to the use of twin CFM56-7B27 engines, while the Split Scimitar Winglets help reduce drag and heighten fuel efficiency. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Report</a>, John Travolta has stated that the plane can travel nonstop for 13 hours. Its incredible fuel range helps it travel up to 6,000 miles at once, taking them anywhere in America and worldwide without hassle. While most celebrities prefer to keep their private aviation in airport hangars, John Travolta keeps his planes at his side.</p><h2 id=closer-to-home>Closer To Home</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2002, John Travolta became an ambassador for Qantas airlines and rented several of their airlines before buying some for himself. Since then, the actor has always wanted to create a private hangar outside his home so he could whisk off in an airline whenever he wants. In the early 2000s, he built a house in Florida that had access to the world with his private jets. As stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, the Qantas Boeing 707 is parked in his backyard in a private hangar. His home has two private runways for landing and take-offs. While the 7,500-foot runway was a bit far from the house, Travolta custom-created a taxiway that could directly access the house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>While being a trained and professional pilot for many years, John Travolta</a> did experience a hiccup when he dodged a near-death experience in 1992 when he was flying to Washington from his home during cloudy weather. An electric failure caused him to make an emergency landing, but everyone was safe and sound. The actor has since been more careful with the technical details of his private jets.</p><p>Aviation has always been a passion of John Travolta, who began flying as a child and continues to prosper in the field through intense training and flying hours. With his growing jet collection, the actor likes to travel in style and comfort while making easy trips to places that would require hours via cars.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside Jeffree Star's "Colorful" Multi-Million-Dollar Closet</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Movies</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Report</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrzEnqJmoZ6otqWxjK2fnmWclsGmecmon6dlpKeut7vLrZisZZ2qubW1jKagpaSZpLtusM6lo5qqXaW%2FqsLArZxmopWpfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-late-john-travoltas-multi-million-dollar-private-jet.html&text=A%20Peek%20Inside%20John%20Travolta%27s%20Multi-Million-Dollar%20Private%20Jet&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-peek-inside-the-late-john-travoltas-multi-million-dollar-private-jet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-late-john-travoltas-multi-million-dollar-private-jet.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20John%20Travolta%27s%20Multi-Million-Dollar%20Private%20Jet" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-late-john-travoltas-multi-million-dollar-private-jet.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20John%20Travolta%27s%20Multi-Million-Dollar%20Private%20Jet" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-late-john-travoltas-multi-million-dollar-private-jet.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20John%20Travolta%27s%20Multi-Million-Dollar%20Private%20Jet" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-late-john-travoltas-multi-million-dollar-private-jet.html&description=A%20Peek%20Inside%20John%20Travolta%27s%20Multi-Million-Dollar%20Private%20Jet" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gina-gershon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Actress Gina Gershon Bio, Age, Net Worth, Movies and TV Shows.">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./southern-charms-landon-clements-addresses-cameran-eubanks-exit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Southern Charms Landon Clements Addresses Cameran Eubanks Exit">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

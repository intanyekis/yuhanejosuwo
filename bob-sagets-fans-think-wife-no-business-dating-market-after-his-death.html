She addressed this in a TikTok video on March 10, 2024. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I'm gonna start by saying unless you are a widow or a widower</a>, you truly have absolutely no place and no right to comment on this because you do not know what it's like," she said. "You just don't understand the incredibly complex and difficult and dynamic thoughts and feelings that come up during this entire process."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-kelly-rizzo-said-about-bob-saget-39-s-death>What Has Kelly Rizzo Said About Bob Saget's Death?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bob-saget-and-kelly-rizzo-smiling.jpg><p>In the same video, Rizzo was candid about the roller coaster of emotions she had gone through after losing her partner. The topic of dating has been difficult for her because "just having those thoughts, you feel guilty, you feel ashamed, you feel horrible, but yet you also feel lonely, so you wanna do it." She continued, "For every person, it's different. There is no one size fits all, but there is absolutely no room for judgment."</p><p><strong>Rizzo has made no secret of the pain she has experienced after Saget's death</strong>. "My whole heart. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob was my absolute everything</a>," she said in a statement to Us Weekly. "I am so completely shattered and in disbelief. I am so deeply touched by the outpouring of love and tribute from our friends, family, his fans, and his peers."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-kelly-rizzo-and-bob-saget-get-married>When Did Kelly Rizzo And Bob Saget Get Married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bob-saget-and-kelly-rizzo-event-1.jpg><p><a href=#>Rizzo and Saget were married in October 2018 in a small ceremony</a>. It was Saget's second marriage, and he spoke with great emotion about being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">given a second chance at love</a> (he was previously married to Sherri Kramer, <a href=#>with whom he had three daughters</a>). "I didn't think I'd have a relationship again," he told Closer Weekly in 2017. "I was kind of in that 'just work, make people happy and take care of your kids until they're 90' mindset."</p><p>The feeling of adoration between Rizzo and Saget was mutual, and their relationship was filled with sweet moments. <strong>Rizzo has also discussed her grief on Instagram</strong> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared photos from happier times</a>. In January 2024, she posted a picture of herself and Saget on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My incredible husband. The world will never be the same," she captioned the image. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She tried to look at the positives in the same month</a>, although it was difficult. "My sweet husband. After much reflection this week, I'm trying, really trying, to not think I was robbed of time. But instead to think: How lucky was I that I got to be the one to be married to THE MOST INCREDIBLE MAN ON EARTH," Rizzo captioned a photo of herself and Saget, smiling into the camera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZqJpdqK6osdOsZJ%2BZnqh6tbTIp6Jmr5mbsm66zmaZrquZo7K0v4ydmK2hnpx6rq3RpJytZZGbwaa%2BjKGgrGWUmq61tI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbob-sagets-fans-think-wife-no-business-dating-market-after-his-death.html&text=Bob%20Saget%27s%20Fans%20Think%20His%20Wife%20Has%20No%20Business%20Putting%20Herself%20Back%20Onto%20The%20Dating%20Market%20After%20Hi&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbob-sagets-fans-think-wife-no-business-dating-market-after-his-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbob-sagets-fans-think-wife-no-business-dating-market-after-his-death.html&title=Bob%20Saget%27s%20Fans%20Think%20His%20Wife%20Has%20No%20Business%20Putting%20Herself%20Back%20Onto%20The%20Dating%20Market%20After%20Hi" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbob-sagets-fans-think-wife-no-business-dating-market-after-his-death.html&title=Bob%20Saget%27s%20Fans%20Think%20His%20Wife%20Has%20No%20Business%20Putting%20Herself%20Back%20Onto%20The%20Dating%20Market%20After%20Hi" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbob-sagets-fans-think-wife-no-business-dating-market-after-his-death.html&title=Bob%20Saget%27s%20Fans%20Think%20His%20Wife%20Has%20No%20Business%20Putting%20Herself%20Back%20Onto%20The%20Dating%20Market%20After%20Hi" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbob-sagets-fans-think-wife-no-business-dating-market-after-his-death.html&description=Bob%20Saget%27s%20Fans%20Think%20His%20Wife%20Has%20No%20Business%20Putting%20Herself%20Back%20Onto%20The%20Dating%20Market%20After%20Hi" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dj-jazzy-jeff-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DJ Jazzy Jeff Net Worth  How Much is Jeff Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./feud-bette-and-joan-cast-side-by-side-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bette &amp;amp; Joan Cast  A Side-By-Side Guide Of Whos Playing Who  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

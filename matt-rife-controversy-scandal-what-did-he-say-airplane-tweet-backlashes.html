His career, however, has not been without controversy, since his comedy frequently crosses the line between enjoyment and offense, resulting in situations that have caused criticism from a variety of sources.</p><h2><span id=Matt_Rife_Airplane_Tweet>Matt Rife Airplane Tweet</span></h2><p>Rife’s most recent disagreement stemmed from a tweet about aircraft accidents, a topic that is inherently sensitive due to the tragic consequences of such events. His remark about surviving a vehicle accident angered many individuals, leading to accusations of insensitivity toward the victims.</p><p>“Bro, I’m DYING at how people think surviving plane crashes would go down,” the actor said in a tweet. If you cause MY luggage to “not survive” an emergency landing, you’re not fit for this planet. Rife later tweeted, “I know you were all concerned.” I got there with my backpack.</p><p>Now that I’ve angered so many individuals who care much too much, I can sleep comfortably.” His dismissive tone in response to the criticism just fueled the fire, demonstrating a lack of remorse for the damage inflicted by his dark and edgy comedy.</p><h2><span id=Matt_Rife_Scandal_Controversy>Matt Rife Scandal & Controversy</span></h2><p>Matt Rife’s previous tweets, which frequently arrived and vanished rapidly, were soiled by accusations of prejudice. During the COVID-19 outbreak, a deleted tweet targeted the cast of “Parasite” at the Oscars, eliciting intense outrage due to its racially charged undertones. “Everyone at the #Oscars is watching to see if the cast of Parasite coughs,” she teased, implying that the Asian actors had been infected with the coronavirus.</p><p><strong>“You’re not funny, you’re a douchebag,” remarked one Twitter user. Apart from the apparent fact that the cast is from KOREA rather than China, racism isn’t humorous.</strong></p><p>Meanwhile, the comedian removed his tweet immediately but then stated that he posted a joke here and on my Instagram Story, and the responses were OUTRAGEOUSLY different. “Proves once again that THIS is the worst social media platform.” “A bunch of cry babies,” Matt went on to say. Rife’s apparent indifference to the demonstrations only fueled the already simmering conflict, exposing a recurring pattern.</p><h2><span id=Matt_Rifes_Previous_Tweets_Have_Resurfaced>Matt Rife’s Previous Tweets Have Resurfaced</span></h2><p>Rife’s earlier tweets from 2012, which included racial and homophobic epithets, emerged in 2016. According to Nicki Swift, Rife had a heated Twitter argument with another user named Brandon Wardell, which culminated in the publication of his previous posts. Several of the comedian’s tweets contained racial and homophobic epithets.</p><p>According to the publication, Rife attempted to justify himself on Snapchat, but the cartoon was met with outrage and disdain. Rife also made an offensive joke on Twitter that year, writing,</p><p><strong>“If I had a superpower, it would be the ability to leap high and sprint quickly…””I’d be referred to as a ‘Black Guy,'” Radar reports.</strong></p><p>In a 2017 interview, Rife fiercely denied claims of racism and homophobia, blaming his prior remarks on adolescent inexperience. However, his subsequent run-in with the law as a result of another dubious statement demonstrated how the specter of earlier difficulties lingered over his career.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>TIKTOKER</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Cleopatra Coleman | Net Worth, Salary And Earning</a></h3>The powerful presence of Australian actor, writer, and artist Cleopatra Coleman has graced both large and small screens.She started acting at an early age and quickly gained notoriety for her outs <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Queen Cleopatra | Craig Russell Weight Loss Journey</a></h3>Craig Russell's calendar is full.

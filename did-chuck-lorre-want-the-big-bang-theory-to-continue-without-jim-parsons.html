We can't say the same for the rest of the cast, with most, prepared to extend for a 13th season.</p><p>Parsons admitted that his decision to walk away didn't have anything to do with the show or its future. He came to terms, <a href=#>due to fatigue and the health of his dog at the time.</a></p><p><a href=#>Parsons</a> said alongside TV Guide, "Our final contract was for the last two years, but no one knew when we signed it what that would mean. I kind of had a suspicion in my heart that that was going to be it for me when I did sign that contract, but you never say never and who knows."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Unlike Others On The Show, Simon Helberg Was Ready For The Big Bang Theory To End</a></span></p><p>He continued, "I was exhausted, and I was really upset about, more than anything, one of our dogs was getting really at the end of his life around then."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a major decision and one that caught a lot of the cast off-guard, including Kaley Cuoco.</p><h2 id=kaley-cuoco-was-shocked-by-jim-parsons-choice-to-leave-the-show>Kaley Cuoco Was Shocked By Jim Parsons' Choice To Leave The Show</h2><p>Ending such a show is never easy, and then factor in the bond of the cast, it made things that much harder. Kaley Cuoco in particular was ready for a season 13. <a href=#>She really didn't envision ending the show at that point.</a></p><p>During a meeting, Jim Parsons stated that he was done and this completely blindsided Cuoco. She recalls the experience alongside Variety, “Jim said, ‘I don’t think I can continue on.’ And I was so shocked that I was literally like, ‘Continue on with what?’ Like, I didn’t even know what he was talking about. I looked at Chuck: ‘Wow. I thought we were — I’m so blown away right now.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Why Did Raj Wear So Many Layers On The Big Bang Theory?</a></span></p><p>The cast was a united one, making it clear that they all entered together, and would leave at the same time as well. Cuoco admitted that the decision became a bit easier to process during the final season, however, it still wasn't easy, especially during the final table ready for the finale.</p><p>Given the success of the sitcom, fans always wonder if there was a plan in place to possibly continue on without Parsons. Other shows have used this formula in the past.

However, Lorre did tinker with the idea of continuing on, if that's what everyone wanted.</p><p>"It’s the tank in Tiananmen Square. I’m not the guy to stand in front of it. Proceed. If they wanted to keep going, I would’ve said “God bless.” It’s hundreds of people that are making a living on this show. You don’t want to stop that," he told THR.</p><p>Lorre continued, "Considering the extraordinary success and the economic nature, I didn’t want to step in front of it. It gets bigger than you and you’ve just got to get out of the way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From his own personal perspective, Lorre did not want to continue on, especially given his history on shows that followed that formula.</p><p>"Long ago decided that I didn’t want to do a series if any of the principal players were not in it. I didn’t want to explain away the absence of a major character. I didn’t want to do Archie’s Place. You don’t just pull it apart and put it back together again and expect the same results."</p><p>Most fans can agree the correct decision was taken up by the cast and those behind the scenes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmLW2r8pmo6iqopp6uK3NrWStoJVir6qzjJuYp59dqbWmu9GyZK2nXZi8r8DIp6yeZaeewam71K1ko6GdYr2ivtKopaxn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-chuck-lorre-want-the-big-bang-theory-to-continue-without-jim-parsons.html&text=Did%20Chuck%20Lorre%20Want%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20To%20Continue%20Without%20Jim%20Parsons%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-chuck-lorre-want-the-big-bang-theory-to-continue-without-jim-parsons.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-chuck-lorre-want-the-big-bang-theory-to-continue-without-jim-parsons.html&title=Did%20Chuck%20Lorre%20Want%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20To%20Continue%20Without%20Jim%20Parsons%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-chuck-lorre-want-the-big-bang-theory-to-continue-without-jim-parsons.html&title=Did%20Chuck%20Lorre%20Want%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20To%20Continue%20Without%20Jim%20Parsons%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-chuck-lorre-want-the-big-bang-theory-to-continue-without-jim-parsons.html&title=Did%20Chuck%20Lorre%20Want%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20To%20Continue%20Without%20Jim%20Parsons%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-chuck-lorre-want-the-big-bang-theory-to-continue-without-jim-parsons.html&description=Did%20Chuck%20Lorre%20Want%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20To%20Continue%20Without%20Jim%20Parsons%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nathan-blau-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nathan Blau  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./danileigh-parents-race-boyfriend-age-is-danileigh-black.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DaniLeigh Parents, Race, Boyfriend, Age  Is DaniLeigh Black?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

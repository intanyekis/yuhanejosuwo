Their excessive displays of PDA and ever-evolving romance have kept fans glued to social media to see what they do next, and their followers were pleasantly surprised to see the two embark on <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a romantic trip</a> to Italy together. This wasn't just an ordinary trip, either. It was packed with romance and a very meaningful leap of faith on the part of Travis Barker. Travis was the lone survivor of a fatal plane crash that left him with third-degree burns over the majority of his body. Due to the intense trauma that he faced after the crash, he hadn't flown since that fateful day that his plane went down. Since dating Kourtney, he was able to overcome his fear, and the two embarked on <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a romantic international flight.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EOnline</a> reports that these lovebirds certainly showed the world that they know how to celebrate this milestone moment and appreciate the love they share for one another. In true Kardashian style, they have embarked on some of the most spectacular adventures that Italy has to offer, and they've spared no expense.</p><h2 id=dolce-amp-gabbana-fashion-show>Dolce & Gabbana Fashion Show</h2><p>The Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda Fashion Show attracted <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the "who's who" in the world of fashion</a>, and of course, Kourtney and Travis scored front row seats alongside their family. They were able to catch the very best view of the supermodels strutting their stuff on the runway and looked completely at ease among the exclusive guests that attended this lavish event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, they made sure to look the part, too. Kourtney dropped big bucks on an ultra-sheer Dolce & Gabbana dress, while Travis boldly opted to wear a sleek, all-black suit without a dress shirt underneath. His chest and neck tattoos were his fashion accent, and the two cozied up to one another for the duration of this event.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Famous Travels: Six Most Expensive Celebrity Vacations</a></span></p><h2 id=yacht-life>Yacht Life</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">For most people, a yacht is quite out of reach</a>, but Kourtney and Travis dropped a whole lot of money on a private, luxury yacht while vacationing in Italy, and they seemed to enjoy every single moment aboard their incredibly expensive vessel. Clearly smitten with another, they posed for a variety of selfies as they took in the sights of the clear skies and smooth waters. They enjoyed some of the most wondrous views of the Italian landscape and were able to fully appreciate the rich culture and incredible natural elements that surrounded them.</p><p>The yachting life included some elaborate snacks and a whole lot of sun-worshipping. Escaping to the open water together afforded Kourtney and Travis the luxury of isolation and freedom from the paparazzi, and they took full advantage of their time together, smooching on the deck and enjoying one another's company.</p><h2 id=touring-italy-in-a-gondola>Touring Italy In A Gondola</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soaking up the luxurious lifestyle that Italy has to offer, Kourtney and Travis discovered the region from their very own private Gondola. They truly lived the life that millions of their adoring fans could only ever dream of, as their guided gondola showed them the sights of the picturesque Italian landscape, the city, and all of the incredible architecture that most people can only dream of experiencing. The relaxing, romantic afternoon was a refreshingly slow pace compared to the usual paparazzi frenzy that surrounds them. They were able to relax and unwind while they toured the space from the comfort of the slow-moving waters, posing to snap selfies to share with their fans.</p><h2 id=shopping-and-dining>Shopping And Dining</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being a Kardashian and dating a Kardashian equates to being able to indulge in all aspects of a vacation! Enjoying the most expensive food and drinks that Italy has to offer, Kourtney and Travis hit up the most prestigious hot spots in Portofino and indulged in the hearty Italian cuisine and, of course, the wine. They made sure to venture out for every meal and selected the top-end restaurants catered by the region's most talented chefs. Kourtney and Travis stunned the locals each time they stepped out. Truly proving to be a power couple in every sense of the word, they dressed to the nines each time they embarked on a restaurant adventure, and of course, they ordered the most elaborate menu items each time. Without any limits or financial hesitations, these lovebirds enjoyed the flavors of the region to the very fullest.</p><p>They held hands as they frolicked in the street and enjoyed some authentic gelato, popping in and out of shops with no limit to their spending and not a care in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No stranger to haute-couture, Kourtney made some stops at some of the finest shops and was able to pick out some incredible outfits to take home with her. Surely soon to be shared with fans, her Italian threads.</p><p>Judging by the incredible time they had together while soaking up the rich Italian culture that surrounded them, it's fair to assume Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker will embark on another expensive vacation together very soon.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber, The Kardashians, & More Love These 5 Dubai Hotels</a></span></p><p>Sources: S<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">creenrant,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EOnline</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Magazine</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8qorKusnprGbrfAq5uaq5ierq95wKebZqyilsOqv4ybmKujlad6tbvOpGSaZZqWxG6w0ainqaGenHqtwdeuqaKnpah6tb7IqWStp12ewaK42Gg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-took-a-jaw-dropping-luxurious-trip-to-italy.html&text=Kourtney%20Kardashian%20And%20Travis%20Barker%20Took%20A%20Jaw-Dropping%20Luxurious%20Trip%20To%20Italy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-took-a-jaw-dropping-luxurious-trip-to-italy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-took-a-jaw-dropping-luxurious-trip-to-italy.html&title=Kourtney%20Kardashian%20And%20Travis%20Barker%20Took%20A%20Jaw-Dropping%20Luxurious%20Trip%20To%20Italy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-took-a-jaw-dropping-luxurious-trip-to-italy.html&title=Kourtney%20Kardashian%20And%20Travis%20Barker%20Took%20A%20Jaw-Dropping%20Luxurious%20Trip%20To%20Italy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-took-a-jaw-dropping-luxurious-trip-to-italy.html&title=Kourtney%20Kardashian%20And%20Travis%20Barker%20Took%20A%20Jaw-Dropping%20Luxurious%20Trip%20To%20Italy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-took-a-jaw-dropping-luxurious-trip-to-italy.html&description=Kourtney%20Kardashian%20And%20Travis%20Barker%20Took%20A%20Jaw-Dropping%20Luxurious%20Trip%20To%20Italy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./268153-martin-lawrences-daughter-jasmine-is-dat-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Martin Lawrences Daughter Jasmin Is Dating Eddie Murphys Son Eric  Glimpse inside Their Rel">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vanessa-laine-bryant.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kobe Bryant wife, Vanessa Laine is very much depressed with loss of husband and daughter, Gianna Bry">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

It's been a handful of years, so, it's time to stack them up. Here's the cast of this hit franchise now, ranked by net worth (according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><h2 id=willow-shields---2-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Willow Shields - $2 Million</span></h2><p>This actress's first starring role was in this series, as Primrose Everdeen, and with that and more, she's made herself a $2 million net worth. She was on&nbsp;Dancing With the Stars in 2015, and most recently, she's starring in the series,&nbsp;Spinning Out.</p><p>She only has just over a dozen credits to her name, but she has two movies currently in production. Plus, for where this 20-year-old is at, her net worth is certainly impressive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amandla-stenberg---2-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Amandla Stenberg - $2 Million</span></h2><p>This young actress definitely made her claim to fame playing Rue in&nbsp;The Hunger Games,&nbsp;but right after, she had a recurring role in the series,&nbsp;Sleepy Hollow.&nbsp;This actress made waves as Rue, but her career is certainly far from over.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>17 Things That Were Cut From The Hunger Games Movies</a></span></p><p>Most recently, she's starred in huge gits like&nbsp;The Darkest Minds&nbsp;and&nbsp;The&nbsp;Hate U Give.&nbsp;With another flick is production, this actress's career is only just beginning.</p><h2 id=josh-hutcherson---20-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Josh Hutcherson - $20 Million</span></h2><p><a href=#>Josh Hutcherson was a heartthrob</a> for all teens growing up, and he's been acting since he was a young child. Of course, his fame was solidified when he portrayed Peeta Mallark, and everyone couldn't help but fall in love with him.</p><p>However, unlike the others, Hutcherson's career actually slowed down, and most of his fame and fortune came from his earlier years. Obviously, he's just living his best life, and starring in some television series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stanley-tucci---25-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Stanley Tucci - $25 Million</span></h2><p>It might be surprising that this acting legend has such a modest net worth, but he's also slid over to the television scene, and less box office hits He was perfect as Caesar Flickerman in&nbsp;The Hunger Games,&nbsp;though, and there's no one that could have done it better.</p><p>Fans should watch out for this actor, though, because he's hitting the big screen hard in the next couple of years with a handful of new movies. One of these includes the newest flick of another series,&nbsp;The King's Man.</p><h2 id=liam-hemsworth---26-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Liam Hemsworth - $26 Million</span></h2><p>Liam Hemsworth stole everyone's hearts when he starred <a href=#>alongside Miley Cyrus</a> in&nbsp;The Last Song,&nbsp;but he proved his versatility and talent - and his handsomeness - when he hit the big screen as Gale Hawthorne.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Little Known Facts About Liam Hemsworth’s Private Life</a></span></p><p>With just a couple of dozen acting credits to his name, it's actually wildly impressive that his net worth is what it is.

This actress has a whopping amount of films and shows under her belt, and it's no surprise she has such a net worth.</p><p>Of course, she mainly participates in comedies and dramas, and this teen series was definitely one of the top box office hits for this talented and popular actress.</p><h2 id=lenny-kravitz---50-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lenny Kravitz - $50 Million</span></h2><p><a href=#>This musical legend</a> can definitely attribute most of his impressive net worth to his huge success in the music industry, but movie fans were super happy to see him hit the big screen and bring Cinna to life.</p><p>While music is his game, he has dabbled in acting, but this is undoubtedly his biggest role in film. Of course, fans can listen to his beautiful voice in a ton of movie soundtracks.</p><h2 id=donald-sutherland---60-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Donald Sutherland - $60 Million</span></h2><p>It's unlikely that anyone could have been as convincing as President Snow as this long-time actor.

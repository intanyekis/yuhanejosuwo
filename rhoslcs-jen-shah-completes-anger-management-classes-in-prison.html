Even though class has ended, I will be carrying around my RSA worksheet in case I run into conflict while here,” Shah continued. “Ultimately, I can’t control what others will do, but I can control how I choose to respond and react with the tools I learned in class … #ZenJen.”</p><p>The Utah native rose to fame after appearing in the hit series from 2020 to 2022. While filming season 2, Shah <a href=#>made headlines when she was arrested</a> for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p><p>After initially pleading not guilty, Shah later changed her plea and admitted that she knew what she was involved in was “wrong and illegal.” The U.S. Attorney’s office dropped the second charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering as a result of the plea change.</p><p>Ahead of her sentencing, Bravo executive producer <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> revealed he wasn’t sure if Shah <a href=#>would return to the network amid her legal woes.</a></p><p>“She’s being sentenced so I don’t know what to say to people who want her on the show,” Cohen, 55, exclusively told Us in November 2022. “I hope that she gets no jail time whatsoever and she can come right back … but I have a feeling that she’s not going to be available to be on the show. Some people on Twitter were saying, ‘We want Jen next season.’ And I’m like, ‘OK, well, talk to the judge.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RHOSLC-Star-Jen-Shah-Reveals-She-Completed-Anger-Management-Classes-While-Serving-Out-Prison-Sentence3.jpg><p>Two months later, Shah <a href=#>was sentenced in January to 78 months with five years</a> of supervised release. She has since remained focused on her personal growth and <a href=#>has not remained in touch with her former RHOSLC costars</a>.</p><p>Shah’s assistant and close friend <strong>Murilo Bueno</strong> revealed to Us in May that <a href=#>only <strong>Meredith Marks</strong> has reached out</a>. “As far as I know, no [one is contacting Jen]. The only person that has reached out to me asking how she was doing was Meredith,” Bueno shared at the time. “Other than that, no one has reached out — to me at least — and I’m pretty sure no one has with her as well.”</p><p>Bueno went on to say that Shah has <a href=#>received support from her family after surrendering herself</a> to FPC Bryan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RHOSLC-Star-Jen-Shah-Reveals-She-Completed-Anger-Management-Classes-While-Serving-Out-Prison-Sentence2.jpg><p>“She can have visitations every weekend. We are trying to stay up there as much as we can every weekend and we kind of just all spread out. We have a spreadsheet and everyone signs up so we can see who is going when. They finally changed COVID policy so now she can have more visitations through the month,” he continued. “Before, it was once a month which limited everyone because it was the only Saturday, it was a second Saturday day of the month. So it just made it harder. And now it’s Saturday, Sunday, and then holidays as well. So we get to spend more time with her, which is awesome.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to Bueno, it remains unclear <a href=#>whether Shah will return to reality TV</a> after her sentence is over.</p><p>“I think she just wants to have a fresh start. She wants to be able to make a difference because she was experiencing and seeing a lot of different stories of women in there,” he told Us. “And I mean, I have always — from 10 years ago — said that Jen is my <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>. So I’m like, ‘Can we go fight everyone with Kim?’ I’m gonna jump in of course for that friendship so they can go save some lives and get some people out of prison.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BouaS%2FjKOcp2Wjna6pecKopKmklamytHnAp56eql2irq%2Btxp6knqakYrCtrdKsnKxlmaN6sb7IrKanZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frhoslcs-jen-shah-completes-anger-management-classes-in-prison.html&text=RHOSLC%27s%20Jen%20Shah%20Completes%20Anger%20Management%20Classes%20in%20Prison&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhoslcs-jen-shah-completes-anger-management-classes-in-prison.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhoslcs-jen-shah-completes-anger-management-classes-in-prison.html&title=RHOSLC%27s%20Jen%20Shah%20Completes%20Anger%20Management%20Classes%20in%20Prison" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frhoslcs-jen-shah-completes-anger-management-classes-in-prison.html&title=RHOSLC%27s%20Jen%20Shah%20Completes%20Anger%20Management%20Classes%20in%20Prison" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frhoslcs-jen-shah-completes-anger-management-classes-in-prison.html&title=RHOSLC%27s%20Jen%20Shah%20Completes%20Anger%20Management%20Classes%20in%20Prison" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhoslcs-jen-shah-completes-anger-management-classes-in-prison.html&description=RHOSLC%27s%20Jen%20Shah%20Completes%20Anger%20Management%20Classes%20in%20Prison" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./salary-of-nigeria-president-full-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Salary of Nigeria President: Full Details">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fossil-forum.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fossil Forum  List of Fossil Discussions and Forums">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

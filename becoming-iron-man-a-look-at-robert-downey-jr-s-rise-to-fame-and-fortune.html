In contrast to other Hollywood actors who strive to maintain a pristine reputation, Downey Jr. encountered a number of severe scandals throughout his career. Included in this was a time of substance misuse and legal issues.</p><p>Despite such ups and downs, he maintained a healthy balance between his career and personal life. He received both critical and public acclaim for his acting roles. Time magazine called Downey Jr. one of the 100 most influential persons in the world, while Forbes ranked him as the <a href=#>highest-paid actor in Hollywood</a>. Let’s look at Robert Downey Jr.’s rise to fame and fortune.</p><h2 id=the-early-success-of-rdj>The Early Success Of RDJ</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robert Downey Jr. joined the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York when he was a teenager. Following the split of his parents, Downey Jr. went to California with his father. Later, he quit Santa Monica High School and moved to New York to pursue acting professionally. When he first arrived in Hollywood to pursue a career in acting, Downey and Kiefer Sutherland lived together as housemates for three years.</p><p>Downey Jr. began his career in the theater. In 1985, he was cast as a new and younger cast member on Saturday Night Live (SNL). However, the show had low ratings, and his comedic abilities were questioned. Eventually, he was removed and replaced. In the same year, he made his dramatic acting breakthrough by portraying <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Spader's sidekick in Tuff Turf</a> and subsequently a bully in John Hughes' Weird Science. He was even considered for the role of Duckie in Pretty in Pink by John Hughes. His first leading role was in The Pick-Up Artist alongside Molly Ringwald.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1992, he portrayed Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin, for which he meticulously prepared. Learning to play the violin as well as left-handed tennis. He received individual instruction on Chaplin's posture. For this, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor but ultimately lost to Al Pacino for Scent of a Woman. He has since begun experimenting with his roles. These include the Marisa Tomei and Woody Harrelson films Only You and Natural Born Killers. Restoration, Richard III, Home for the Holidays, Two Girls and a Guy, U.S. Marshals, and Black and White followed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Becoming Forrest Gump: Here's How Tom Hanks Became A Hollywood A-Lister</a></span></p><h2 id=the-fall-from-grace-and-success>The Fall From Grace And Success</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From 1996 until 2001, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Downey Jr. encountered numerous difficulties</a>, which had an effect on his career. He was arrested multiple times on drug-related offenses, including cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. While driving along Sunset Boulevard in April 1996, he was caught for possession of heroin, cocaine, and an unloaded.357 Magnum handgun. Later, he was compelled to undergo mandatory drug testing. He spent six months in Los Angeles County jail because he missed one of them. In 1999, after failing another drug test, he was detained again. Downey Jr. was sentenced to three years in jail at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and California State Prison in Corcoran, California.</p><p><a href=#>RDJ later made a comeback</a> as he was released after serving a year in the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison. A week later, he joined the cast of the popular television show Ally McBeal as a new romantic interest. He was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. Even after all of this, he continued to face numerous other grave charges and allegations. From judicial proceedings to jail time, Downey Jr. reached rock bottom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Becoming Spider-Man: A Look At Tom Holland's Rise To Fame And Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=the-resurrection-of-iron-man>The Resurrection Of Iron Man</h2><p>After five years of substance usage, arrests, rehabilitation, and relapse, <a href=#>Downey Jr. was prepared to achieve success</a> and return to his career, and work toward a full recovery from drugs. August 2001 marked his first acting role following recovery. The video for Elton John's hit "I Want Love" features lip-syncing. Despite his extensive critical acclaim throughout his career, he did not have any blockbuster pictures. In 2008, everything changed. Iron Man and Tropic Thunder were both critically and commercially successful films starring Robert Downey Jr.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Iron Man director John Favreau urged that Robert Downey Jr. perform the role. As he desired him to be a franchise-carrying lead actor, comparable to Johnny Depp in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, he compared him to Johnny Depp. To look the part, he had to grow more than 20 pounds of muscle in five months. The triumph of The Avengers eventually cemented <a href=#>Iron Man as the face of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</a> The first job he took after Iron Man was that of Sherlock Holmes in Guy Ritchie's film. It was the eighth highest-grossing movie of 2009.</p><p>Later on, he reprised his role as Tony Stark in the sequel to Iron Man, which was the first of two planned sequels to the original film. Iron Man 2 was the seventh highest-grossing movie of the year 2010. His other popular films include Due Date, starring Zach Galifianakis, and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, alongside Noomi Rapace. Then, in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, he reprised his role as Tony Stark and the rest is history.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Cast Of ‘The Rings Of Power’, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Empire Weekly</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Story</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CEOtudent</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvpq%2FOpqCnn12ev7C6jKaYp2WRYrmwu8pmmK1loqSvpr7TZpuor56axm620WaqZqqZqLJuwM5mnZqllWKur7CMn6arrKWjsnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbecoming-iron-man-a-look-at-robert-downey-jr-s-rise-to-fame-and-fortune.html&text=A%20Look%20At%20Robert%20Downey%20Jr.%27s%20Rise%20To%20Fame%20And%20Fortune&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbecoming-iron-man-a-look-at-robert-downey-jr-s-rise-to-fame-and-fortune.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbecoming-iron-man-a-look-at-robert-downey-jr-s-rise-to-fame-and-fortune.html&title=A%20Look%20At%20Robert%20Downey%20Jr.%27s%20Rise%20To%20Fame%20And%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbecoming-iron-man-a-look-at-robert-downey-jr-s-rise-to-fame-and-fortune.html&title=A%20Look%20At%20Robert%20Downey%20Jr.%27s%20Rise%20To%20Fame%20And%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbecoming-iron-man-a-look-at-robert-downey-jr-s-rise-to-fame-and-fortune.html&title=A%20Look%20At%20Robert%20Downey%20Jr.%27s%20Rise%20To%20Fame%20And%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbecoming-iron-man-a-look-at-robert-downey-jr-s-rise-to-fame-and-fortune.html&description=A%20Look%20At%20Robert%20Downey%20Jr.%27s%20Rise%20To%20Fame%20And%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alan-greisman-was-married-to-sally-field-bio-other-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alan Greisman Was Married To Sally Field- Bio, 7 Other Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./steve-buscemi-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steve Buscemi Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
